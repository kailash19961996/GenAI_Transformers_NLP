Lily wanted to share the needle with her mom, so she could sew a button on her shirt.\\n\\nLily went to her mom and said, \"Mom, I found this needle. Can you share it with me and sew my shirt?\" Her mom smiled and said, \"Yes, Lily, we can share the needle and fix your shirt.\"\\n\\nTogether, they shared the needle and sewed the button on Lily\\'s shirt. It was not difficult for them because they were sharing and helping each other. After they finished, Lily thanked her mom for sharing the needle and fixing her shirt. They both felt happy because they had shared and worked together.'],\n",

Good fuel made Beep happy and strong.\\n\\nOne day, Beep was driving in the park when he saw a big tree. The tree had many leaves that were falling. Beep liked how the leaves fall and wanted to play with them. Beep drove under the tree and watched the leaves fall on him. He laughed and beeped his horn.\\n\\nBeep played with the falling leaves all day. When it was time to go home, Beep knew he needed more fuel. He went to the fuel place and got more healthy fuel. Now, Beep was ready to go fast and play again the next day. And Beep lived happily ever after.'],\n",

The crab looked at Fin and said, \"No, I don\\'t want to play. I am cold and I don\\'t feel fine.\"\\n\\nFin felt sad but wanted to help the crab feel better. He swam away and thought of a plan. He remembered that the sun could make things warm.
