Sue tried to help the flower. She gave it water and put it near the window. But the flower did not get enough sun. It tried very hard to bloom, but it could not. The flower became sad and said, "I am sorry, Sue. I cannot be a fancy flower in your room."

Lucy listened carefully, but the words were all strange to her. She then noticed one wealthy man pointing to his toes. She wondered why and asked her dad, "What's he pointing at?"

Her dad laughed and smiled, "That man is showing off his money! He's wealthy and he wants everyone to know."

This made little Lucy excited. She wished she had money too. She wanted to show off her wealth like the man.

But then her dad said something that made her sad. He said, "It's just playing pretend. You don't need money to have fun!"

So Lucy put away her dreams of being wealthy and went back to playing with her toys. But secretly she still hoped one day she could show off her own wealth too!

Once there was a boy who liked to run. Every day he ran faster and faster. He was so fast that he seemed to float rather than run! One day, his mommy gave him a weight to carry. It was big and heavy, but the boy didnâ€™t mind. He held on tightly and ran with it, as if it were nothing.

He ran for hours and hours, never stopping for a rest. The weight grew heavier and heavier, but the boy never thought about it. He kept on running, ever faster and ever further.

Then, all of a sudden, the boy felt himself trip! He had been so careless, he couldnâ€™t keep his footing. He had been running too fast and too far, with too much weight in his hands. The weight had been too heavy for him, and as he fell, he knew that he had gone much too far. Now it was time to turn around and run back home.

Once upon a time there was a coat frame. It was fit for a special occasion. A little girl named Rachel came to try it on.

"It looks beautiful," said her mother. Rachel smiled in delight.

The frame was no longer disturbed. It was standing up straight and Rachel looked wonderful. That's how Rachel got to wear the perfect coat frame for her special day!

One day, Lizzie spotted a rabbit hopping along the country road. She looked at her car and said, â€œOh dear! We need to speed up or weâ€™ll never catch this rabbit!â€ So, Lizzie put her foot down on the pedal and the car began to go faster.

The rabbit kept hopping along, faster and faster, until it was a tiny blur on the horizon. But the car managed to keep up, going at a modest speed. In the end, Lizzie drove her car all the way to the end of the country road and the rabbit hopped off into the sunset.

One day, Mary was sitting on the grass in the park, eating a sandwich. She chewed it slowly, looking around. Suddenly, something sparkly caught her eye - it was a silver necklace glistening in the sun. Mary noticed it was near a bush, so she crawled over to take a closer look. 

When she got close, Mary could see that the necklace was suspended from a thin branch. She reached out to take it in her tiny hand and felt it's cool metal. 

Just then, a voice called out from behind her. It was an old woman. 
 
"Do you like it?" she said.

Mary was a bit anxious but nodded and smiled.

"It's yours," the woman said warmly. "I saw you admiring it and thought you might like to have it."

Mary thanked the woman politely, before heading home with the new silver necklace in her pocket. From that day onward, every time Mary chewed her lunch in the park, she would also play with her silver necklace, and think back to the day when she had first seen it.

Suddenly, her friend Mary came over and asked if she wanted to play. Lucy said yes but Mary thought of something else to do. She wanted to cut her chalk in half. 

Lucy was not happy about this. She didn't want anyone to mess with her original chalk. But, Mary kept insisting and said, "C'mon Lucy, let's cut the chalk! It'll be fun!"

Lucy refused but with some convincing from Mary, she agreed to it. So, they got a knife and started cutting the chalk. But, to their surprise, the chalk pieces became smaller and smaller until the chalk disappeared.

Lucy felt sad. She knew that her chalk could never be the same again. Better not to mess with an original.

Amy said, â€œCan you paint my bedroom? It would look so much better.â€

The painter smiled again and said, â€œYes, I can do that for you. I can make it very special.â€

Lola gasped in surprise and said, "I did it!" She grabbed one of the pastry pieces and took a big bite. It tasted so sweet and delicious. 

Suddenly, Lola heard her mother's voice and she knew it was time to go home. She quickly picked up the other piece of pastry and ran to her mother. 

Lola showed her mom the pastry and said, "Look what I found!" Her mother smiled and said, "It sure looks yummy. Now let's put it in a bag until we get home."

Max was so happy he began to settle in. He was grateful for his friends' help. He felt safer in his nest and didn't feel so helpless anymore.

One day Max had an idea. He asked his friends, "What if I set up a will? That way, if something happens to me, you can take care of my nest."

Max's friends thought this was a great idea. So Max wrote a will that his friends would follow after he was gone. He was so relieved to have this plan in place. 

Max's friends made sure to take care of him and the nest. With their help, Max was able to settle in to his new home peacefully.

Once upon a time, there was a light beetle. He had never been outside and wanted to see the world.

So one day, the beetle crawled out of its box and looked around. Suddenly, he saw a big tree and decided to climb it. He worked up the trunk and made it to the top, but found he was stuck.

"Help!" the beetle cried.

Just then, a bird flew by and heard the beetle's cry.

"What's wrong little beetle?" asked the bird.

The beetle explained what had happened, and the bird laughed.

"My friend, the ant, can help you," said the bird. "Let me take you to her."

The bird took the beetle to the ant, who said she could help. She pulled and tugged, and the beetle worked his way around the branch, until he was finally free.

"What are you trying to do, Jack?" asked his mother, who had just seen him.

"I am trying to print the pill, mum," answered Jack. 

"Oh, the pill is too small to print. Let's find something else that is bigger and easier to print," said his mother.

So, Jack and his mother went outside and found a big red leaf which they printed. Jack was very happy! The printed leaf was very colourful and beautiful. From then on, Jack kept printing lots of colourful things.

Mummy was getting angry now. She told Timmy, "If you don't give me the hanger, you won't get any ice cream." Timmy still refused and said he wanted to pick it himself. He stomped his feet on the floor.

Once upon a time, there lived an orange tree. All the oranges on the tree were delicious and juicy. The tree wanted to share its delicious oranges with the world. One day, it decided to give away all of its oranges to the local animals.

The animal friends were delighted! The squirrels, birds, rabbits, and more all shared the oranges. They each had as much as they wanted to eat. But the tree remained sad, for it no longer had any oranges left to share.

Just then, the sun began to shine brighter and the sunâ€™s warmth brought new life to the tree. Its branches were soon filled with many delicious oranges. 

This time, the tree decided to be more careful. It only gave away five oranges each day and kept the rest. This made it happy and it could remain generous without becoming empty.

The moral of this story is that if we are generous, we can remain happy and still have a lot to give.

"I want to join!" the little girl shouted happily.

One of the adults in the parade saw the little girl and gave her a big smile. "Come on" he said, diving into the parade, "Come join the fun!"

The little girl followed him and started to dance with the other children. Everyone was laughing and having a great time.

But soon the little girl became frustrated. She couldn't keep up with the other children, and they were all having more fun than her. But then one of the adults came over and said:

"Come on, let's show them how to dive in this parade."

With a big smile, the little girl followed the adult and started to dance and sing. Soon, she was singing and dancing just like the other children, and everyone was having a great time. The little girl was happy and no longer frustrated.

He ventured in. Soon enough, he came across an extraordinary sight. A giant tree that had a swing that went way up high, so high he could touch the sky. He was so excited he just had to give it a try. So he climbed up the tree and squeezed himself onto the swing seat. 

He started swinging and swaying and before long he was feeling so merry and carefree. Suddenly, he felt a massive hand squeeze him tight. He looked around and saw an old and miserable giant. The giant spoke in a grumbling voice, "You don't belong in my forest, get away!" 

The little boy was scared and quickly jumped down from the swing. He was so sad, he had to leave the wonderful adventure he had been having. He quietly went home, feeling more than a little miserable.

Suddenly, they spotted a pile of match boxes near the harbor. Jack and Jill were so excited, they grabbed one of the match boxes and began to match the colorful boxes. They played at the harbor all day, matching the pretty match boxes until the sun started to go down.

Jack ignored her and he went nearer and nearer. Jill got worried and she said, "Jack stop! I'm scared!"

Jack didn't listen and he was about to jump in. Jill got very scared, so she shouted, "No Jack! Panic!"

Jack was so sorry, he jumped back and started crying. Jill hugged him tight and said, "It's ok, Jack. Don't worry. I'm sorry I scared you." 

Jack smiled and they hugged each other. They never came near the well again. 

The end.

Once upon a time there was a white phone. The phone was special and could fold out. One day, a little girl, who was three years old, saw the phone and said "Wow!" 

The girl wanted to play with the phone, so she carefully folded out the phone. She thought the phone looked like a butterfly. She was very excited and started to giggle.

The girl's mother saw her playing with the phone and said, "No, you must be gentle with it. Folding the phone out is a special thing you can only do when you get older." 

The little girl understood and started to fold the phone back together. When she finished folding it, she said "Wow!" again. Then she put the phone carefully back on the table. 

The end.

Once there was a strong stone. It wanted to stay by itself so it could be alone. But that was hard to do in the forest. Every day an animal would come by and try to move the stone. But the stone was strong and wouldn't budge.

Then one day, a butterfly flew by and asked the stone why it wanted to stay by itself. The butterfly said it would like to be friends with the stone. The stone was very happy.

The butterfly and the stone became great friends. Every day, the butterfly would come to visit and stay with the stone. The stone was so glad that it didn't have to be alone any more. It was strong and would stay with its friend forever.

Mummy was with her little girl in the park. The little girl loved to play on the swings and they had been there a long time. 
Mummy said, "We should go soon. It's getting dark."
But the little girl protested, "No, I want to stay here!" She was having so much fun. 
Mummy sighed. She urged the little girl to leave, but the little girl's feelings were too strong.

Mummy was starting to worry. She was worried about the darkness, and that the little girl might get tired and weak. She said, "Come on sweetheart, we must go now."
The little girl felt a bit weak, so finally she agreed to go. Mummy was happy, because she was no longer worried.

A mummy and her little girl called Sarah were getting ready to go on a trip. Sarah watched as her mummy packed a big sack with lots of things.

"What's in that sack, Mummy?" asked Sarah.

Mummy replied, "It's full of lots of fun things that we can take with us on our trip."

Sarah asked, "Can I take my dolly?"

Mummy replied, "Yes of course, but you will have to pack it into the sack yourself."

Sarah was excited and put her dolly safely into the big sack. She looked up at her mummy and smiled.

On the trip, Sarah met lots of friendly people and things she had not seen before. She was having a wonderful time. 

When it was time to go home, Sarah remembered that she had put her dolly in the sack and so she checked to make sure it was still there. It was! 

Mummy said to her, "Isn't it nice when things are packed up neatly and safely?"

Sarah nodded and smiled.

The moral of the story is to be careful to always pack up things neatly and safely, which helps us to take care of our possessions.

But mom said no, it was too little and she was too old. 
Molly was so sad and asked, "Why can't I sleep in my crib? It's so cozy and fun!"

Mom said, "It's too small, Molly. You're getting so big that you need a big bed now. Come on, I'll have a fun time picking out a big bed with you!" 

Molly smiled. She wasn't sure why her crib couldn't be her bed anymore, but it was funny to think of sleeping in a big bed!

Once there was a bear who loved spicy food. He always used to pick the spiciest of all the food in the village. One day, he was making his usual rounds at the village market when he saw his friend, the rabbit. The bear waved and the rabbit bowed in response.

The bear asked the rabbit what he had in his basket and the rabbit replied, "I'm bringing yummy carrot cake to my grandmother. It's her favourite."

The bear immediately started drooling. He asked the rabbit if he could have some and the rabbit said, "Sure, but it's really spicy. Are you sure you can take such a pain?"

The bear was too excited to wait. He eagerly took the carrot cake and bit into it. Alas! The bear had never tasted such a spicy food before. Suddenly his mouth was on fire and he yelped in pain.

The bear learnt a lesson that day: when it comes to food, not everything that tastes fancy is necessarily best for you.

Once upon a time, there was a brave turtle. She was very small, but full of courage. One day, she decided to explore the big world and find new things.

The turtle smiled and started to play with the stones and crystals. She forgot about the time, until it got dark and she decided to crawl back home.

The turtle was very happy. She found an amazing place she never knew existed before. Whenever she felt sad, she remembered that magical place she'd seen and smiled.

Once upon a time there was a fat penny. She looked so shiny and beautiful that she made a young boy smile. The boy picked up the penny and decided to take it home with him.

When he arrived home, the boy's mother said, "You can't keep the penny, it doesn't belong to us. You have to return it."

The boy wasn't too happy about that but he had no choice. He slowly walked back to the place where he had found the penny and put it back on the ground. 

Suddenly, a fat rat jumped out of nowhere and snatched the penny away. The boy was so surprised that he forgot to chase after the rat.

The boy never saw his penny again. He was very sad.

The boy was surprisedâ€” he thought it was unusual but very cool! He asked the lady to teach him sign language and she gladly agreed!

From then on, the little boy and the lady shared a special bondâ€” they both knew that being different could be a wonderful thing.

John was walking outside on a warm summer day. He was laughing and feeling happy. Suddenly, he saw a small pile of ash on the ground. He smiled and decided to explore what it was. He bent down and opened the pile of ash. Inside, he saw a little bird. It was still alive, but barely. John smiled and ran to find help for the bird. 

He called to a man walking by and asked for help. The man said "No, I don't care. Leave it alone and get away from it." John said "Please help the bird. It needs my help."

Andy was scared and didn't want to join the other kids. His mom said, "Come on, Andy. You will learn something here, and it will be fun too!" 

At first, Andy was hesitant, but eventually, he gathered his courage and went to the playground. He felt a bit dull there, but he soon found out that he could make new friends. In addition, he was able to learn all kinds of things in the park.

Each day, Andy spent time in the park with his new friends. He learned how to climb up a tall slide, prices of different things he saw, how to swing with grace, and more.

Suddenly, Sandy saw a butterfly fluttering in the sky. She was mesmerized. She started to walk towards it when her mommy yelled "wait, Sandy!"

Sandy stopped and looked back at her mommy. Her mommy blinked and smiled. "Let's go and have a picnic," she said.

So they spread a blanket on the grass and unpacked the food. While they ate, the butterfly flew down and landed on Sandy's shoulder. Sandy gasped in surprise and smiled. She closed her eyes and blinked slowly. She felt so happy.

Afterwards, Sandy and her mommy packed everything away and headed home. Sandy couldn't stop smiling. She promised herself that she would always remember that special day at the park.

Tom was confused. He asked, "What does that mean?" His mom explained, "It means that it will appear again. Everyone and everything has their ups and downs, just like the comet. Just be patient and it will come back to us." 

Tom nodded and looked up at the night sky. He was no longer worried. He knew that everything will come back even if it seems to be gone for a while. 

Tom had learned a valuable lesson from his mom: don't worry even if something is gone for a while. It will rise again.

Jimmy was swinging in the playground. He loved being high up in the air and how it made him feel so light. His friends were there too and everyone was having a great time.

Suddenly, Jimmy heard a loud noise. He stopped swinging and looked around. He saw a jar lying on the ground near the swing. He ran to it and picked it up. The jar had a gentle pattern, with blue and yellow flowers.

Jimmy brought the jar closer to his eyes and saw a ladybug crawling around inside. It was really tiny. He smiled and called his friends.

"Look what I found!" he said. 

His friends gathered around him and all looked at the little lady bug. They oohed and ahhed and said it was so cute.

Then the lady bug stopped and Jimmy decided to set it free. He opened the jar's lid and gently turned it upside down. The lady bug hopped out and flew off into the sky, free to explore its new world.

Jimmy smiled and watched until it was out of sight. Then he went back to swing with his friends. That had been an exciting find and he couldn't wait to tell his mom about it when he got home!

One day, he stumbled across two little kittens. They were feeling scared and alone, so the bear was very generous. He shared some of his clay with them and the kittens were so happy.

So Clarissa went outside. She thought about running away but everything inside her was telling her to give them a chance. As she stepped out of the house, the soldiers saw her and called her name.

Clarissa was still feeling grumpy so instead of walking toward them, she ran away and started to weep. The soldiers were startled by her reaction but they followed her anyway and finally caught up to her.

The sun was shining brightly as John stepped out of his tiny house. He was an ignorant child who loved nothing more than running and playing. He had an old sheet he used as a blanket and he often imagined himself as a superhero.

John walked closer, hiding behind a bush and peaked through the branches. Mrs. Johnson and a stranger were talking and the stranger seemed to be angry about something. Suddenly, the stranger shouted and stepped towards Mrs. Johnson. John was scared and decided to go back home, but before he could do so, the stranger noticed him.

When Gary approached the wind his friends were worried. They shouted out to Gary to quit the race and come back, but Gary didn't listen. He wanted to prove that he was the fastest. 

The wind started to pick up and Gary was struggling to keep up. Soon enough, he was too tired to keep up with the wind and Gary had to quit the race. 

Poor Gary! All this excitement had been for nothing.

The moral of this story? It's important to remember your limits and to quit when things get too hard.

The little girl ran to get her toy axe. She said â€œIâ€™ll help you, Daddy. Iâ€™ll use my axe to chop the wood.â€

Daddy said â€œThatâ€™s a great idea! But you need to be careful because the axe is very sharp.â€ 

The little girl got to work and chopped up some wood. She was careful and everything went well.

After they painted the house, Daddy said â€œLook how nice it looks now. Letâ€™s go inside, itâ€™s too hot outside.â€ 

The little girl said â€œYay! Daddy, youâ€™re the best house painter!â€ 

And everyone was happy. The End.

Once upon a time, Lucy the bee was flying in the meadow. She was looking for a place to build her hive.

Suddenly, she saw a small, hairy bush. She flew over to take a closer look and saw that it was perfect!

"I'll make my home here," she said happily. She started to gather pieces of wood and flowers to build her hive.

Just then, a butterfly flew by. "What are you doing?" asked the butterfly.

"I'm building my home," Lucy said.

The butterfly smiled. "That's very nice," he said. "But what if something happens to it?"

"I don't know," Lucy said, frowning.

The butterfly nodded. "That's why it's important to build your hive with friends," he said. "If something happens, everyone can help."

Lucy smiled, and set to work with her new friends. After much hard work, they managed to finish the hive together.

The moral of this story is that it is always better to work with friends. That way, if something happens, we can help each other out.

"Peter, come and sit too!" she shouted.

But Peter said he couldn't because it would be too rough.

Like a tornado, Winnie put the trumpet down and got off it - shocked. She had realised that the trumpet belonged to somebody else and she was sorry for trying to take it.

Although Winnie felt sad and guilty, Peter gave her a big hug and said "It doesn't matter what happened. Just be kind and honest to everyone. That's the most important lesson we can ever learn!".

Jane continued her walk, thinking about the skull. She knew she shouldn't have tasted it. Suddenly, a voice said "Why did you taste the skull?".
It was a small creature with red wings. "It looked interesting so I thought I'd try it", Jane replied. "That was a very wrong thing to do," said the creature. "Skulls are not meant to be tasted."

Her eyes grew wider as she heard what sounded like an echo of her own whisper. 

Curious, she asked the curtains, "Can you understand me?". The curtains didn't move. She whispered the question again and waited. She heard a faint whispering in response, but it wasn't the same as if she were speaking. This whisper felt different somehow. 

The girl waited and listened. Suddenly, the curtains moved again. This time they were pushing back, inviting her closer. As the girl looked closer, she saw a crack in the window and she could now hear more clearly the voice she had heard earlier. "Come here," it said. 

The girl took a deep breath, trembling with anticipation and excitement. She stepped closer and the curtain parted. Behind it was a secret garden. Everything was clean and vibrant and the girl felt more alive than she had ever felt before. She was finally on an adventure of her own.

Suddenly it heard a voice from down below. 
"Haha!" Someone laughed, "that's my fire! I burnt it bigger and stronger, so the ash would fly!" 

The bird flew down to see what was happening. It saw a small figure standing by a campfire. 

The bird asked, "Why do you want the ash to fly?" 

"Because," the figure replied, "when it floats across the land, it makes things more bitter for the people who live here. That's why I like to make my fire bigger and stronger."

Lily and Ben started to eat, but Ben was not very hungry. He looked at Lily's doll and wanted to play with it. He put his spoon down and reached for the doll. "Can I have your doll, Lily?" he asked.

Lily was not happy. She loved her doll and did not want to share it. She held the doll tightly and said, "No, Ben. This is my doll. You have your car."

He thought maybe Sara would like to play with his toy car too. He went to her door again and knocked. He said he wanted to share his toy car with her. He said they could play together and have fun.

Sara said no. She said she did not like toy cars. She said they were boring and silly. She told him to go away again.

Her brother was very sad. He sighed and went to his room. He did not want to play with his toy car alone. He wished Sara would be nice to him and share her books.

But Sara did not care. She kept reading her book about the weather. She thought she was very smart and did not need anyone else.

But then something happened. The weather changed. It started to rain very hard. The rain made a loud noise on the roof and the windows. Sara was scared. She did not like the rain. She wanted it to stop. She wanted to see the sun again.

She ran to her mom and dad. She said she was afraid of the rain. She asked them to make it stop. They said they could not make it stop. They said the rain was part of the weather and they had to wait for it to pass. They said they could read a book or play a game to pass the time.

Sara said she did not want to read a book or play a game. She said she wanted to see the sun. She said she hated the rain. She said she hated the weather.

Her mom and dad looked at her. They said she was not being smart. They said she was being selfish and rude. They said she should be grateful for the books she had and the weather she had. They said she should be kind to her brother and sister and share with them. They said they loved her, but they were disappointed in her.

Sara felt bad. She realized she had been wrong. She realized she had hurt her brother and sister. She realized she had been ungrateful and foolish. She sighed and said she was sorry. She said she wanted to be smart and nice. She said she wanted to share her books and play with her brother and sister. She said she loved them and the weather.

Her mom and dad smiled. They said they were proud of her. They said they forgave her. They said they loved her too. They hugged her and said they would read a book and play a game with her and her brother and sister.

Sara was happy. She ran to her room and opened the door. She saw her brother and sister waiting for her. They had brought their books and toys. They said they wanted to share with her and learn with her and have fun with her. They said they loved her and the weather.

Sara smiled. She said she loved them and the weather too. She said she was sorry for being mean. She said she wanted to be smart and nice. She said she wanted to share her books and play with their toys. She said they were the best brother and sister ever.

They hugged and laughed. They read the book about the weather and played with the toy car. They learned about the sun, the rain, the wind and the snow. They had fun and were happy.

The rain stopped. The sun came out. The weather was beautiful. Sara was smart and nice. She learned a lesson. She learned to share and be kind. She learned to love her family and the weather. She learned to be happy.

Tom and Lily liked to play near the station. They saw big trains and cars and people. They liked the noise and the colors. Sometimes they found things on the ground, like cans and coins and papers. They liked to lift them and look at them.

One day, they saw a big box near the station. It was brown and had a red sign on it. They did not know what the sign meant. They thought it was a picture of a flower. They wanted to see what was in the box. They ran to the box and tried to lift it.

But the box was not harmless. It was a bomb. It had a timer and a wire. When Tom and Lily lifted the box, they moved the wire. The bomb made a loud beep and then a big boom. The box exploded and hurt Tom and Lily and the station and the people. There was fire and smoke and noise and pain.

Tom and Lily did not play near the station anymore. They did not play at all. They were gone. The people were sad and angry. They said Tom and Lily should not have touched the box. They said the box was dangerous and had a warning sign. They said Tom and Lily should have listened and learned.

The moral of the story is: Do not touch things that you do not know. They might be harmful and hurt you and others. Listen to the signs and the people who know better. Be careful and safe when you play.

Jill likes to skip. She skips to school, she skips in the park, she skips at home. She is happy when she skips. She thinks skipping is fun.

One day, Jill skips to the farm. She sees a big horse. She wants to skip with the horse. She goes near the horse and says, "Hello, horse. Do you want to skip with me?" The horse looks at Jill and shakes his head. He says, "No, thank you. I do not skip. I run. Skipping is for little girls, not for big horses."

Jill feels sad. She thinks the horse is not nice. She says, "But skipping is fun. You should try it. It will make you happy." The horse says, "No, I do not need to try it. I know what I like. I like to run. Running is fun. It makes me happy."

Jill does not give up. She says, "Please, horse. Just try it once. Maybe you will like it. Please, please, please." The horse sighs. He says, "Fine. I will try it once. But only once. And then you will leave me alone."

Jill is happy. She says, "Thank you, horse. You are nice. Come on, let's skip." She holds the horse's mane and starts to skip. The horse tries to skip too. But he does not like it. He feels silly and awkward. He trips and falls. He hurts his leg. He says, "Ow, ow, ow. This is not fun. This is bad. I do not like skipping. I like running. Why did you make me skip?"

Jill is sorry. She says, "I am sorry, horse. I did not mean to make you fall. I just wanted to share my fun with you. I thought you would like skipping too. But I see now that you have your own fun. And that is okay. We can have different fun. We can still be friends."

The horse says, "It is okay, Jill. I am sorry too. I was not nice to you. I should have been more polite. I see now that you have your own fun too. And that is okay. We can have different fun. We can still be friends."

Jill and the horse hug. They say, "We are sorry. We are friends. We are nice." Then they see a farmer. He has a bucket of oats. He says, "Hello, Jill. Hello, horse. Are you hungry? Do you want some oats?" Jill and the horse say, "Yes, please. We are hungry. We want some oats." They eat the oats. They are yummy. They are happy.

The moral of the story is: We can have different fun. We can still be friends. We can be nice.

Anna and Ben are twins. They like to play with their toys in their room. Sometimes they share, but sometimes they fight. One day, they both want the same red car. They pull and tug and yell.

"Mine!" Anna says.

"No, mine!" Ben says.

They are so loud that Mom comes in. She looks sad and angry.

"Stop it, you two!" Mom says. "Why are you fighting over a toy? You have so many toys. Can't you be nice to each other?"

Anna and Ben stop and look at Mom. They realize that they are making Mom unhappy. They also realize that they love each other more than the red car. They feel sorry.

"Sorry, Mom," Anna says.

"Sorry, Mom," Ben says.

They hug Mom and then hug each other. They decide to take turns with the red car. They also find other toys to play with together. They laugh and smile and have fun.

Mom smiles too. She is glad that Anna and Ben are getting along. She says, "That's better. Now you are being good twins. I love you both very much."

Anna and Ben say, "We love you too, Mom."

Tom and Mia are friends. They like to play in the pool. The pool is big and blue. Tom and Mia wear swimsuits and goggles. They can see under the water.

"Look, Mia, a fish!" Tom says. He points to a small, yellow fish. The fish swims near the edge of the pool. "Let's dive and catch it!"

"Okay, Tom, but be careful!" Mia says. She follows Tom as he dives into the water. They swim close to the fish. The fish sees them and swims away. Tom and Mia chase the fish. They have fun.

But the fish is fast and smart. It swims under a rock. Tom and Mia cannot see it. They look around. They cannot find the fish. They are sad.

"Where is the fish?" Tom asks. He comes up to the surface. He breathes air. He is tired.

"I don't know, Tom. Maybe it is hiding." Mia says. She comes up to the surface too. She breathes air. She is hungry.

"Let's go back to the poolside, Mia. Maybe we can find another fish." Tom says. He swims to the edge of the pool. He climbs out. He is wet.

"Or maybe we can have a snack, Tom. I have a will in my bag. Do you want some?" Mia says. She swims to the edge of the pool too. She climbs out. She is wet too.

"A will? What is a will, Mia?" Tom asks. He is curious.

"A will is a fruit, Tom. It is round and green and sweet. My mom gave it to me. It is good for you." Mia says. She opens her bag. She takes out a will. She peels it. She breaks it in half. She gives one half to Tom.

"Thank you, Mia. It looks yummy." Tom says. He takes the will. He bites it. He smiles. It is yummy.

"You're welcome, Tom. It is yummy." Mia says. She bites her will too. She smiles. She is happy.

Tom and Mia eat their wills. They are not hungry anymore. They are happy. They are friends. They like to play in the pool.

Tim and Mia are playing in the park. They see a big tent with many animals inside. They want to go and look at them.

"Can we go, Mom?" Tim asks.

"OK, but be careful and stay close to me," Mom says.

They go inside the tent and see many animals. They see a lion, a monkey, a zebra, and a leopard. The leopard is sleeping on a big rock. He has spots on his fur.

"Wow, look at the leopard!" Mia says. "He is so pretty!"

She goes closer to the leopard and tries to touch him. But the leopard wakes up and sees Mia. He is angry. He does not like strangers. He growls and shows his teeth.

"Roar!" the leopard says.

Mia is scared. She runs back to Tim and Mom. The leopard jumps off the rock and chases Mia.

"Help!" Mia cries.

Mom grabs Mia and covers her with her coat. She protects her from the leopard. Tim runs to a man who works in the tent. He tells him about the leopard.

"Help! The leopard is angry and wants to hurt Mia!" Tim says.

The man hears Tim and sees the leopard. He gets a big net and throws it over the leopard. He catches the leopard and puts him back on the rock.

"Sorry, kids. The leopard is not used to people. He is not a pet. He is a wild animal. You should not go near him or touch him. He can be dangerous," the man says.

Mom hugs Mia and Tim. She is glad they are safe.

"Thank you, sir. We are sorry. We did not know. We will not do it again," Mom says.

The man smiles and nods. He gives them some stickers of animals. They say sorry to the leopard and leave the tent. They go to the swings and have fun. They learn to respect the animals and their space.

Tom and Lily like to play with their toy cars. They have many cars of different colors and sizes. They race them on the floor and make loud noises. Sometimes, their cars crash and break. Then, they need to repair them.

One day, Tom's blue car broke its wheel. He was sad and did not want to play anymore. Lily saw him and wanted to help. She said, "Don't worry, Tom. I can repair your car. I have a stamp that can fix it."

Lily took her stamp and showed it to Tom. It was a red stamp with a star on it. She said, "This is a magic stamp. It can make anything better. Watch this." She stamped the broken wheel of the car and said, "Abracadabra!"

Tom looked at his car and saw that the wheel was fixed. He was amazed and happy. He said, "Wow, Lily, you are right. Your stamp is magic. Thank you for repairing my car. You are a good friend."

Lily smiled and said, "You are welcome, Tom. I am glad you like my stamp. It is very reliable. It always works. Do you want to play with me?"

Tom nodded and said, "Yes, I do. Let's race our cars again. But be careful, don't crash them."

They played with their cars and had fun. They did not crash them again. They used Lily's stamp to decorate their cars with stars. They were happy and proud of their cars. They were good friends.

Lily and Ben were hungry. They wanted to eat something yummy. They went to the kitchen and looked at the fridge. The fridge was big and cold. It had a lot of food inside.

"Can we open the fridge?" Lily asked Ben.

"Yes, we can. But we need to ask Mom first," Ben said. He was a good big brother. He knew the rules.

They ran to the living room, where Mom was reading a book. She looked comfortable on the sofa.

"Mom, can we have a snack?" they asked together.

"Sure, my loves. What do you want?" Mom said with a smile.

"We want to open the fridge and see what's inside," Lily said.

"Okay, but be careful. And don't make a mess," Mom said.

Lily and Ben nodded and ran back to the kitchen. They opened the fridge and saw many things. They saw milk, cheese, eggs, fruit, juice, and more. They decided to have some cheese and crackers. They took them out of the fridge and put them on a plate.

"Can you help me, Ben?" Lily asked. She was too small to reach the cupboard where the crackers were.

"Of course, Lily. I'll help you," Ben said. He lifted Lily up and helped her get the crackers. They put them on the plate with the cheese.

They carried the plate to the table and sat down. They ate their snack and enjoyed it. They were happy and full.

"Thank you for helping me, Ben," Lily said.

"You're welcome, Lily. You're my best sister," Ben said.

They hugged each other and smiled. They loved each other very much.

Lily and Ben were playing hide and seek in the park. Lily was the seeker and Ben was the hider. Lily counted to ten and then looked for Ben. She saw a big tree with a hole in it. She thought Ben might be hiding there.

She ran to the tree and peeked inside the hole. It was very dark and she could not see anything. She heard a small voice say, "Boo!"

Lily jumped back and screamed. She saw Ben come out of the hole, laughing. He had a flashlight in his hand.

"Ben, you scared me!" Lily said. "Why did you hide in the dark hole?"

Ben smiled and said, "I wanted to find a good hiding spot. The dark hole was perfect. No one can see me there."

Lily frowned and said, "But it is not fun to hide in the dark. It is scary and cold. And you can't see anything."

Ben shrugged and said, "I don't mind the dark. I have my flashlight. And I can see you when you come close."

Lily shook her head and said, "I don't like the dark. It makes me feel alone and sad. And I can't see your face."

Ben looked at Lily and saw that she was upset. He felt sorry for scaring her. He said, "I'm sorry, Lily. I didn't mean to make you feel bad. Do you want me to explain why I like the dark?"

Lily nodded and said, "Yes, please. Explain to me why you like the dark."

Ben took Lily's hand and said, "Come, I'll show you." He led her to the hole and turned on his flashlight. He said, "Look, the dark is not so bad. It is like a secret place where you can imagine anything. You can pretend you are in a cave, or a spaceship, or a castle. You can make up stories and have fun."

Lily looked at the hole and saw that it was not so scary with the flashlight. She saw some rocks, some leaves, and some bugs. She said, "I see. The dark is like a game. You can use your flashlight to make shapes and shadows."

Ben nodded and said, "Yes, exactly. The dark is like a game. And you can play with me. We can be friends in the dark."

Lily smiled and said, "OK, Ben. I'll try to play with you in the dark. But can we also play in the light sometimes?"

Ben smiled and said, "Of course, Lily. We can play in the light too. We can play hide and seek anywhere. As long as we are together."

Lily hugged Ben and said, "Thank you, Ben. You are a good friend. You explained to me why you like the dark. And you made me feel better."

Ben hugged Lily and said, "You're welcome, Lily. You are a good friend too. You listened to me and you gave me a chance. And you made me happy."

They both laughed and said, "Let's play again!"

They ran out of the hole and looked for a new hiding spot. They played until it was time to go home. They had fun in the dark and in the light. They were happy.

Anna loves to dance. She dances in her room, in the garden, and in the park. She wears a pink dress and a shiny crown. She feels like a princess.

One day, she goes to the park with her mom and dad. She sees a big fountain with water. She runs to the fountain and starts to dance around it. She pretends the water is her music.

"Look at me, Mommy! Look at me, Daddy! I'm a dancer!" she shouts.

But then, a mean boy comes to the fountain. He has a bucket in his hand. He fills the bucket with water and pours it on Anna. Anna gets wet and cold. She stops dancing and starts to cry.

"Ha ha, you're not a dancer, you're a wet rat!" the boy laughs.

"Hey, stop that! That's not nice!" Anna's mom says. She runs to Anna and hugs her. Anna's dad goes to the boy and takes his bucket away.

"Apologize to Anna right now. You don't pour water on people. That's rude and mean." Anna's dad says.

The boy looks scared and sorry. He says sorry to Anna. Anna's mom gives her a towel and a hug. She says it's okay, she's still a dancer and a princess.

Anna feels better. She smiles and says thank you. She decides to forgive the boy. She asks him if he wants to dance with her. The boy nods and says yes. They dance around the fountain together. They have fun and make friends. Anna's mom and dad watch them and smile. They are proud of Anna. She is a kind and brave dancer.

Sam and Lily were playing with their toys in the living room. Sam had a lot of cars and trucks, and Lily had a lot of dolls and animals. They liked to share their toys and make up stories.

One day, Sam had an urge to build a big tower with his blocks. He asked Lily to help him. "Lily, do you want to build a tower with me?" he said.

Lily nodded. "Yes, Sam, that sounds fun. How high do you want to make it?"

Sam thought for a moment. "Very high, like the sky. We need a lot of blocks. Can we use some of your blocks too?"

Lily agreed. "Sure, Sam, we can use some of my blocks. But we have to be organized. We have to sort the blocks by color and size. That way, we can find the ones we need."

Sam and Lily started to sort the blocks. They made piles of red, blue, yellow, and green blocks. They also made piles of big, medium, and small blocks. They worked together and talked to each other.

"Look, Lily, I have a big red block. This can be the base of the tower," Sam said.

"Good idea, Sam. I have a medium blue block. This can go on top of the red block," Lily said.

They continued to supply each other with blocks and stack them on the tower. They made the tower higher and higher, until it reached the ceiling. They were very proud of their tower.

"Wow, Sam, we did it! We made the highest tower ever!" Lily exclaimed.

"Yes, Lily, we did it! We are the best builders!" Sam cheered.

They hugged each other and smiled. They had fun building the tower, and they were happy to share their toys and their urge.

Lily liked to draw pictures with her crayons. She had many colors and shapes to make her drawings. She kept her crayons in a box on her desk in her room. Her desk was big and brown and had a chair that was too high for her. She felt uncomfortable when she sat on the chair, but she did not have another place to draw.

One day, her brother Max came into her room. He wanted to play with her crayons. He did not ask Lily, he just took the box from her desk. Lily was angry. She said, "No, Max, those are my crayons. Give them back to me. You have your own toys to play with." Max did not listen. He ran away with the box to his room. He locked the door and started to break the crayons and throw them on the floor.

Lily cried. She knocked on the door and said, "Max, please, open the door. You are ruining my crayons. I need them to draw. They are my supply of colors." Max did not care. He laughed and said, "Too bad, Lily. I like to play with your crayons. They are fun to break and throw. You can't have them back."

Lily was very sad. She did not know what to do. She went to her mom and told her what Max did. Mom was not happy. She said, "Max, that is not nice. You have to share with your sister. You have to respect her things. You have to apologize and give her back her crayons." She went to Max's room and opened the door. She saw the mess of broken crayons on the floor. She said, "Max, look what you did. You wasted Lily's crayons. You have to clean this up and buy her new ones with your allowance. You also have to say sorry to Lily and hug her."

Max felt bad. He realized he was wrong. He said, "I'm sorry, Lily. I was mean to you. I should not have taken your crayons. I should have asked you first. I will buy you new ones and help you draw. Can you forgive me?" Lily nodded. She said, "I forgive you, Max. Thank you for saying sorry. I love you, brother. Can we play together?" Max said, "I love you, too, sister. Yes, we can play together. But first, let's clean this up and put the crayons back on your desk." They hugged and smiled. Mom was proud of them. She said, "That's good, kids. You learned how to solve your problem and be kind to each other. Now, let's go and have some cookies and milk." They all went to the kitchen and had a happy snack.

Lily and Ben are friends. They like to play in the farm. They see many animals in the farm. They see cows, pigs, sheep and chickens.

One day, they want to feed the chickens. They ask the farmer for some corn. The farmer gives them a bucket of corn. He says, "Be careful with the chickens. They are healthy and strong. They can peck you if you are not nice to them."

Lily and Ben take the bucket of corn and go to the chicken coop. They see many chickens. Some are white, some are brown, some are black. They are noisy and busy. They cluck and flap their wings.

Lily and Ben wave to the chickens. They say, "Hello, chickens! We have some corn for you. Do you want some?" They throw some corn on the ground. The chickens run to the corn. They peck and scratch and eat. They are happy and full.

Lily and Ben smile and watch the chickens. They say, "You are good chickens. You give us eggs and meat. You are healthy and strong. We like you." They wave to the chickens again. They say, "Bye, chickens! See you next time!" They take the bucket and go back to the farmer. They thank him for the corn. They say, "We had fun with the chickens. They are nice to us." The farmer smiles and says, "You are welcome. You are good kids. You are nice to the chickens."

Lily and Ben were friends. They liked to play in the park. One day, they saw a big dog. The dog had a red collar and a long tail. The dog looked friendly.

"Hello, dog!" Lily said. "Do you want to play with us?"

The dog wagged its tail and barked. It came closer to Lily and Ben. Ben was scared of the dog. He hid behind a tree.

"Lily, be careful!" Ben said. "We don't know the dog. It might bite us."

Lily did not listen to Ben. She trusted the dog. She thought the dog was nice. She gave the dog a snack. She had a cookie in her pocket. The dog ate the cookie and licked Lily's hand.

"See, Ben? The dog is helpful. It likes us. It is our friend." Lily said.

Ben shook his head. He did not trust the dog. He thought the dog was greedy. He wanted to go home.

Lily and the dog played for a while. They ran and jumped and rolled on the grass. Ben watched them from the tree. He felt lonely and sad.

Then, something bad happened. The dog saw a squirrel. The dog wanted to catch the squirrel. The dog ran after the squirrel. The dog forgot about Lily. The dog pulled Lily with its collar. Lily fell down. She hurt her knee. She cried.

"Help! Help!" Lily shouted. "The dog is hurting me!"

Ben heard Lily. He ran to help her. He tried to pull the dog away. But the dog was too strong. The dog bit Ben's arm. Ben cried too.

A man came to the park. He saw Lily and Ben and the dog. He was angry. He was the dog's owner. He shouted at the dog. He took the dog away. He said sorry to Lily and Ben. He said they should not play with strange dogs. He said they should be careful.

Lily and Ben were hurt. They were scared. They were sorry. They learned a lesson. They learned to not trust strange dogs. They learned to listen to their friends. They learned to be careful.

Sara was a girl who liked to play with her toys. She had a doll, a ball, a car and a bear. She played with them every day in her room. She made them talk to each other and have fun.

One day, Sara was playing with her bear. She pretended that he was her friend and they went to the park. She said, "Hello, bear. Do you want to go on the slide?" The bear nodded and said, "Yes, Sara. I like the slide. It is fast and fun." Sara smiled and took the bear to the slide. She put him on the top and pushed him down. The bear laughed and said, "Whee! That was fun. Thank you, Sara."

Sara and the bear played on the slide for a long time. They also played on the swings, the seesaw and the sandbox. They had a lot of fun. But soon, Sara felt tired. She yawned and said, "I am sleepy, bear. Let's go home." The bear yawned too and said, "Me too, Sara. Let's go home and take a nap."

Sara and the bear walked back to her room. They saw that Sara's mom was waiting for them. She said, "Hello, Sara. Hello, bear. Did you have fun at the park?" Sara nodded and said, "Yes, mom. We had fun. But we are sleepy now. Can we take a nap?" Sara's mom smiled and said, "Of course, Sara. You can take a nap. But first, you need to wash your hands and face. You are dirty and smelly from playing." Sara said, "Okay, mom. I will wash my hands and face. But what about the bear? He is dirty and smelly too." Sara's mom said, "Don't worry, Sara. I will wash the bear for you. He needs a bath too. Then he will be clean and soft again."

Sara and the bear washed their hands and face. Then Sara's mom took the bear and put him in the sink. She used soap and water to wash him. She rinsed him and dried him with a towel. She gave him back to Sara and said, "Here you go, Sara. Your bear is clean and soft now. He smells good too." Sara hugged the bear and said, "Thank you, mom. You are the best. I love you and I love the bear." Sara's mom said, "I love you too, Sara. And I love the bear too. Now, let's go to your bed and take a nap. You need to rest after playing so much." Sara and the bear said, "Okay, mom. Let's go to bed and take a nap." They followed Sara's mom to the bed. They snuggled under the blanket and closed their eyes. They fell asleep and dreamed of the park. They were happy.

Lily loves to sing. She sings when she wakes up, when she plays, and when she goes to bed. She sings songs about flowers, stars, and animals. She sings with her voice, her hands, and her feet.

One night, Lily has a dream. She sees a big, bright light in the sky. She hears a soft, sweet sound. She looks up and sees an angel. The angel has white wings, a long dress, and a shiny crown. The angel smiles at Lily and says, "Hello, little singer. I like your songs. Do you want to sing with me?"

Lily nods her head. She feels happy and curious. She says, "Yes, please. What is your name? Where do you come from?"

The angel says, "My name is Joy. I come from heaven. Heaven is a place where God and his friends live. We sing praises to God and thank him for his love. Do you know God?"

Lily says, "Yes, I know God. He made me and he loves me. He gave me my family and my friends. He gave me my voice and my songs. I want to thank him too. Can you teach me a song?"

The angel says, "Of course. Listen to me and repeat after me." The angel sings a simple, beautiful song. Lily listens and repeats. They sing together, louder and louder. The light in the sky grows wider and wider. Lily feels warm and peaceful. She thinks, "This is the best dream ever."

Lila and Ben were best friends. They liked to play in the park with their toys. Lila had a doll and Ben had a car. They shared their snacks and had fun.

One day, they saw a big orange cat in the park. It was sitting on a bench, licking its paw. Lila and Ben wanted to pet the cat. They walked slowly towards it.

"Meow," the cat said. It looked at them with green eyes.

"Hello, cat," Lila said. "You are very pretty. Can we pet you?"

The cat did not answer. It arched its back and hissed.

"Be careful," Ben said. "The cat does not like us. It might scratch us."

Lila did not listen to Ben. She reached out her hand to touch the cat. The cat swiped at her with its claws.

"Ow!" Lila cried. She pulled back her hand. It had a red mark on it. It hurt a lot.

"I told you to be careful," Ben said. He was a reliable friend. He always warned Lila when something was dangerous. He took out a tissue from his pocket and wrapped it around Lila's hand.

"Thank you, Ben," Lila said. She was sorry she did not listen to him. She hugged him.

The cat jumped off the bench and ran away. Lila and Ben decided to leave the cat alone. They went back to their toys and played some more. They were happy.

Lily and Tom were hungry. They wanted to eat soup for lunch. Mom said she would make soup for them. She went to the kitchen and put a pot on the stove.

Lily and Tom followed Mom to the kitchen. They saw a big spoon on the counter. It was shiny and silver. Lily liked shiny things. She wanted to play with the spoon.

"Can I have the spoon, Mom?" Lily asked.

"No, Lily, that spoon is for the soup. You can have another spoon to play with," Mom said.

But Lily did not listen. She reached for the shiny spoon when Mom was not looking. She grabbed it and ran away.

Tom saw Lily run away with the spoon. He was confused. Why did Lily take the spoon? He wanted to help Mom with the soup. He ran after Lily.

"Lily, give back the spoon! Mom needs it for the soup!" Tom shouted.

Lily did not want to give back the spoon. She liked the shiny spoon. She ran to her room and hid under the bed.

Tom followed Lily to her room. He looked under the bed. He saw Lily and the spoon.

"Lily, please give back the spoon. The soup will be ready soon. We can share the soup and eat it with our own spoons," Tom said.

Lily looked at Tom. She saw that he was sad. She felt sorry for Tom. She did not want to make him sad. She decided to give back the spoon.

"Okay, Tom, I will give back the spoon. I'm sorry I took it. I just liked the shiny spoon," Lily said.

She gave the spoon to Tom. Tom smiled and thanked her. He took the spoon to the kitchen and gave it to Mom.

Mom was happy to see the spoon. She stirred the soup with the spoon. She smelled the soup. It was hot and yummy.

"Soup is ready, Lily and Tom! Come and eat!" Mom called.

Lily and Tom ran to the kitchen. They sat at the table and waited for Mom to serve them soup. They each got a bowl of soup and a spoon. They ate the soup and enjoyed it.

They were not hungry anymore. They were happy. They liked soup. They liked Mom. They liked each other. They learned to share. They learned to listen. They learned to say sorry. They learned to shine.

Lily and Ben are playing in the park. They find a shiny stone on the ground. Lily picks it up and puts it in her pocket.

"Can I see it?" Ben asks.

"No, it is mine!" Lily says.

"Please, just for a moment," Ben begs.

Lily refuses. She holds her pocket tight. She does not want to share.

Ben is sad. He tries to grab the stone from Lily's pocket. Lily screams and pushes him away. Ben falls and hurts his knee. He cries.

Lily feels bad. She sees blood on Ben's knee. She remembers that Ben is her friend. She takes the stone out of her pocket and gives it to Ben.

"Here, you can have it," she says.

"Thank you, Lily," Ben says. He smiles and wipes his tears.

They hug and say sorry. They share the stone and play together. They are happy.

Lily and Ben are friends. They like to play together. They have a big box of toys. They have cars, dolls, balls, and books.

One day, Lily finds a star in the box. It is shiny and yellow. She likes the star. She puts it on her head. She says, "I am a princess. This is my crown."

Ben sees the star. He wants the star. He is jealous of Lily. He says, "Give me the star. It is mine."

Lily says, "No, it is mine. I found it first."

Ben and Lily start to fight. They pull the star. They yell and cry.

Mom hears the noise. She comes to the room. She sees Ben and Lily fighting. She is not happy. She says, "Stop fighting. The star is for sharing. You can both play with it. Or you can play with something else. But you have to be nice to each other."

Ben and Lily feel sorry. They say, "Sorry, Mom. Sorry, Lily. Sorry, Ben."

Mom gives them a hug. She says, "It's okay. I love you both. Now, let's play together."

Ben and Lily smile. They share the star. They take turns to wear it. They play princess and knight. They have fun. They are friends again.

Ben and Mia are playing in the backyard. They have a small table and some cups and plates. They pretend they are having a tea party.

"Would you like some more tea, Mia?" Ben asks, holding a cup.

"Yes, please, Ben. You are a good server," Mia says, smiling.

They sip their pretend tea and chat about their toys and pets. They hear a noise at the gate. It is the mailman. He has a big bag of mail.

"Hello, Ben and Mia. I have some mail for you," the mailman says, waving.

"Mail for us? Wow!" Ben and Mia say, running to the gate.

The mailman gives them each a colorful envelope. They have stickers and drawings on them.

"Who are they from?" Ben asks, curious.

"They are from your grandma and grandpa. They live far away, but they love you very much. They wrote you some letters and sent you some pictures," the mailman explains.

"Thank you, mailman. You are very nice," Mia says, grateful.

"You're welcome, kids. Have fun reading your mail. And be careful with the scissors," the mailman says, leaving.

Ben and Mia run back to their table. They open their envelopes with scissors. They find letters and pictures inside. They see their grandma and grandpa smiling and waving. They read their letters out loud. They say they miss them and they are proud of them. They also send them some jokes and riddles.

"Grandma and grandpa are very funny," Ben says, laughing.

"They are also very serious. They say we have to be good and listen to our mom and dad," Mia says, nodding.

"We will, grandma and grandpa. We love you too," Ben and Mia say, looking at the pictures.

They put their letters and pictures on their table. They finish their tea party. They hug each other. They are happy. They have mail.

Anna and Ben are playing with blocks in the living room. They like to build towers and houses and bridges with the blocks. They have many colors of blocks: red, blue, yellow, green, and more.

"Look, Anna, I made a big tower!" Ben says, showing his blocks to his sister. "It is very high and strong!"

Anna looks at Ben's tower and smiles. She likes his tower, but she also wants to make her own. She picks up some blocks and starts to build next to Ben.

"Can I have some of your blocks, Ben?" Anna asks. "I need more to make my tower."

Ben shakes his head. "No, Anna, these are my blocks. You have your own blocks. Go away!"

Anna feels sad and angry. She does not like Ben's answer. She wants to share the blocks with him. She thinks he is being mean and selfish.

She decides to do something bad. She pushes Ben's tower with her hand. The blocks fall down and break. They make a loud noise.

"Anna, why did you do that?" Ben cries. "You broke my tower! You are a bad sister!"

Anna feels sorry for what she did. She sees Ben's tears and hears his cry. She knows she made a mistake.

"I'm sorry, Ben, I'm sorry!" Anna says. "I did not mean to break your tower. I was mad at you, but I should not have pushed your blocks. Can you forgive me?"

Ben looks at Anna and sees her face. She looks sad and sorry too. He remembers that she is his sister and he loves her.

"It's okay, Anna, I forgive you," Ben says. "But don't do that again, okay? It is not nice to break other people's things."

Anna nods and hugs Ben. "Okay, Ben, I won't do that again. I love you, brother."

They hug and make up. They decide to share the blocks and build a new tower together. They have fun and play nicely.

The end.

Ben and Lily were twins who liked to play in their room. They had many toys and books and a big bed with soft cushions. One day, they found a new game. They took the cushions and piled them up on the floor. Then they climbed on the bed and jumped on the cushions. They laughed and shouted as they bounced up and down.

"Look at me, I'm a mighty lion!" Ben roared, pretending to have claws and teeth.

"I'm a mighty princess!" Lily said, wearing a crown and a necklace.

They had so much fun that they did not hear their mom calling them for lunch. She came to their room and saw the mess. She was angry and told them to stop jumping and clean up.

"But mom, we're having fun!" Ben said, not wanting to stop.

"Yeah, mom, please let us play a little more!" Lily said, urging her mom to change her mind.

"No, you have to eat and then take a nap. You're making too much noise and you're ruining the cushions. They're not for jumping, they're for sleeping. Now come on, or you'll be in trouble." Mom said, grabbing their hands and pulling them away from the bed.

Ben and Lily were sad and mad. They did not want to eat or nap. They wanted to play. They thought their mom was mean and unfair. They did not say thank you or sorry. They pouted and whined all the way to the kitchen.

But when they came back to their room after their nap, they saw something terrible. The cushions were torn and ripped. The stuffing was everywhere. Their toys and books were broken and dirty. And on the wall, there was a big scratch and a note. It said: "I'm a mighty lion too. And I don't like noisy kids. Next time, be quiet and listen to your mom. Or I'll come back and eat you. Grrr!"

It was their cat, Fluffy, who had done it. He was hiding under the bed, looking smug and satisfied. He had heard them jumping and roaring and had decided to join the game. But he had played too rough and had destroyed everything.

Ben and Lily were shocked and scared. They cried and hugged each other. They wished they had listened to their mom and not jumped on the cushions. They learned their lesson the hard way. They realized that their mom was right and that they had been wrong. They said sorry to their mom and to each other. They helped her clean up the mess and promised to be good and quiet from then on. They hoped that Fluffy would not come back and eat them. They hoped that their mom would forgive them and love them still. They hoped that their cushions would be fixed and their toys and books would be replaced. They hoped that they would find a new game that was fun and safe and did not make anyone angry or sad.

The end.

Lily and Ben were playing in the garden. They saw a big green apple on a tree. Lily wanted to eat it, but Ben wanted to throw it.

"Give me the apple, Lily. I want to play with it," Ben said.

"No, Ben. It is my apple. I want to eat it. It is yummy," Lily said.

They pulled the apple from each other. The apple broke in half. They both dropped the pieces.

"Oh no! We destroyed the apple!" Lily cried.

A bird flew down and picked up one piece. A squirrel ran and took the other piece.

"Look, Lily. The bird and the squirrel are happy. They like the apple," Ben said.

"Maybe they are hungry. Maybe we can share with them," Lily said.

They smiled and waved at the bird and the squirrel. They went to find more apples to share.

Lily and Ben were playing with marbles on the floor. They had many marbles of different colors and sizes. They liked to roll them and make them hit each other.

"Look, I have a big red marble. It is mighty. It can knock down all your marbles," Ben said. He rolled his red marble and hit Lily's blue marble. Lily's blue marble rolled away.

"That is not nice, Ben. You should share your marbles and play fair," Lily said. She was sad and angry.

"I don't want to share. I want to win. My red marble is the best," Ben said. He rolled his red marble again and hit Lily's green marble. Lily's green marble rolled away.

Lily had only one marble left. It was a small yellow marble. She did not think it was mighty. She thought it was weak. She wanted to cry.

But then she had an idea. She picked up her yellow marble and poked Ben's red marble with it. Ben's red marble did not roll. It cracked.

"Hey, what did you do? You broke my red marble. That is not fair," Ben said. He was shocked and sad.

"I poked it. You said it was mighty, but it was not. It was fragile. You should not be mean and boastful. You should be kind and humble," Lily said. She felt sorry for Ben, but also proud of her yellow marble.

Ben looked at his broken red marble and then at Lily's yellow marble. He realized that he was wrong. He said sorry to Lily and asked her to be his friend. Lily smiled and said yes. They hugged and shared their marbles. They learned that size and color do not matter. What matters is how you treat others.

Lily and Tom are playing in the kitchen. They want to cook a cake for mom. Lily is bossy. She tells Tom what to do.

"Tom, get the eggs. Tom, get the flour. Tom, get the milk. Tom, get the sugar. Tom, get the bowl. Tom, get the spoon. Tom, get the pan. Tom, hurry up!" Lily says.

Tom is tired of Lily's orders. He does not have fun. He wants to do something else.

"Lily, I don't want to cook. I want to play with my cars. You are too bossy. You do everything yourself." Tom says.

Lily is angry. She wants to cook with Tom. She thinks cooking is fun. She does not want to play with cars. She thinks cars are boring.

"Tom, you are silly. Cooking is fun. Cars are boring. You have to help me. We are a team. Mom will be happy if we cook a cake for her." Lily says.

Tom and Lily start to argue. They raise their voices. They make a mess. They spill the eggs, the flour, the milk, and the sugar. They drop the bowl, the spoon, and the pan. They do not notice mom coming home.

Mom sees the kitchen. She sees Lily and Tom. She is not happy. She is angry.

"Lily and Tom, what are you doing? Why are you making such a noise? Why are you making such a mess? You are not cooking. You are fighting. You are not a team. You are naughty." Mom says.

Lily and Tom feel sorry. They stop arguing. They apologize to mom. They help mom clean the kitchen. They hug mom. They say they love her.

Mom forgives Lily and Tom. She hugs them back. She says she loves them too. She says they can cook a cake together another day. She says they have to be nice to each other. She says they have to share and take turns. She says they have to have fun.

Lily and Ben were playing in the park. They liked to run and jump and slide. They saw a big hill with a lot of trees. They wanted to discover what was on the other side.

"Let's go, Lily!" Ben said. "Maybe we can find a treasure or a secret cave!"

"OK, Ben!" Lily said. "But be careful. It looks dark and spooky over there."

They ran up the hill, holding hands. They heard a loud noise. It was the wind. It was blowing hard and making the trees shake and the leaves fly.

"Wow, look at the wind, Lily!" Ben said. "It's so strong and fast!"

Lily felt scared. She did not like the wind. It made her cold and it made her hair go in her eyes. She wanted to go back to the park.

"Ben, I don't like the wind," Lily said. "Can we go back, please?"

Ben looked at Lily. He saw that she was scared. He wanted to make her feel better.

"OK, Lily," Ben said. "We can go back. But first, let's do something fun. Let's make a kite!"

Ben found a stick and a plastic bag. He tied the bag to the stick with a string. He gave it to Lily.

"Here, Lily," Ben said. "This is a kite. You can hold it and let the wind lift it up. It will fly like a bird!"

Lily took the kite. She felt curious. She wanted to try it.

"Thank you, Ben," Lily said. "How do I make it fly?"

Ben showed her how to hold the string and run with the kite. They ran down the hill, laughing and shouting. The kite flew high in the sky, dancing with the wind.

Lily felt happy. She liked the kite. She liked the wind. She was not scared anymore.

She hugged Ben and said, "You are the best, Ben. You made me discover something new and fun. I love you."

Ben hugged her back and said, "I love you too, Lily. You are the best, too. You made me discover something new and sweet."

Tom likes to polish his dad's razor. He thinks it is a shiny toy that makes his dad's face smooth. He waits for his dad to go to work, then he sneaks into the bathroom and takes the razor from the drawer. He rubs it with a cloth until it sparkles.

One day, Tom sees a unique thing on the wall. It is a big mirror that shows him and the razor. He wonders what will happen if he touches the razor to his face. He thinks it will make him look like his dad. He lifts the razor and moves it closer to his cheek.

But the razor is not a toy. It is sharp and hurts Tom. He feels a sting and sees red on his face and on the mirror. He drops the razor and starts to cry. He runs to his mom and shows her his boo-boo. She is scared and angry. She hugs him and puts a band-aid on his cut. She tells him to never touch the razor again. She says it is dangerous and not for kids.

Tom is sorry and sad. He does not want to polish the razor anymore. He says he is sorry to his mom and his dad. He learns his lesson and plays with his safe toys instead. He likes his cars and his blocks and his teddy bear. He does not need the razor to look like his dad. He loves his dad and his dad loves him, even with a band-aid on his face.

Tim and Sue were friends. They liked to play with toys and eat snacks. One day, they found a big bag of prunes in the kitchen. They thought prunes were yummy and sweet.

"Let's eat some prunes!" Tim said.

"OK!" Sue said.

They opened the bag and took out some prunes. They put them in their mouths and chewed. But the prunes were not yummy and sweet. They were dry and sour and bitter. They made their faces twist and their tongues hurt.

"Yuck!" Tim said. "These prunes are stupid!"

"Yuck!" Sue said. "They are bad!"

They spat out the prunes and threw them on the floor. They were angry and sad. They wanted something good to eat.

They looked around the kitchen and saw a big cake on the table. It was white and pink and had candles on it. It looked yummy and sweet.

"Let's eat some cake!" Tim said.

"OK!" Sue said.

They ran to the table and grabbed some cake. They put it in their mouths and smiled. It was yummy and sweet. It made their faces happy and their tongues glad.

"Mmm!" Tim said. "This cake is good!"

"Mmm!" Sue said. "It is nice!"

They ate more and more cake. They did not care about the prunes. They did not see the note on the table. It said: "Happy Birthday, Mom! Do not touch the cake!"

They ate all the cake. They felt full and sick. They clapped their hands and laughed. They thought they were clever and funny.

But they were not clever and funny. They were naughty and rude. They did not know that Mom was coming home soon. They did not know that Mom loved cake and wanted to share it with them. They did not know that Mom would be very angry and sad when she saw what they did.

They did not know that they were in big trouble.

The end.

Anna liked to sign with her hands. She learned sign from her teacher at school. She had many friends who also signed. Anna was deaf, but she was not sad. She could talk and listen with her eyes and hands.

One day, Anna went to the park with her daddy. She saw a big slide and wanted to try it. She signed to her daddy, "Can I go on the slide, please?" Her daddy smiled and nodded. He signed, "Yes, you can. Be careful and have fun."

Anna ran to the slide and waited for her turn. She saw a boy in front of her. He had curly hair and a red shirt. He looked at Anna and said something. Anna did not hear him. She smiled and signed, "Hello, I am Anna. What is your name?"

The boy frowned and said something again. He pointed at his mouth and shook his head. He did not sign. He did not understand Anna. He was ignorant. He pushed Anna and said, "Go away, you are weird. You can't talk."

Anna felt hurt and scared. She did not like the boy. She did not want to play with him. She ran back to her daddy and hugged him. She signed, "Daddy, the boy was mean to me. He did not sign. He did not like me."

Her daddy hugged her back and kissed her head. He signed, "I am sorry, Anna. The boy was ignorant. He did not know how to sign. He did not know how to be kind. You are not weird. You are wonderful. You can talk. You can sign. You are my smart and brave girl. I love you."

Lily liked to play with her toys on the big cushion in the living room. She had a doll, a bear, a car and a ball. She made them talk and move and have fun. One day, she saw a fly on the cushion. It was not moving. Lily touched it with her finger. It was dead.

Lily felt sad for the fly. She wanted to help it. She ran to the kitchen and got a cup of water. She poured some water on the fly. Maybe it was thirsty, she thought. But the fly did not wake up. It was still dead.

Lily got an idea. She ran to her room and got a blanket. She wrapped the fly in the blanket and put it on the cushion. She said, "Good night, fly. I hope you have good dreams." Then she got her doll and hugged it. She said, "Thank you, doll, for being my friend. You are not dead. You are alive and happy."

Lily's mom came into the living room and saw Lily and her doll on the cushion. She smiled and said, "What are you doing, Lily?" Lily looked up and said, "I am playing with my toys, mom. And I am saying thank you to them. They are good toys. They make me happy."

Lily's mom sat down next to Lily and said, "That's very nice of you, Lily. It's good to say thank you to the things and people that make you happy. And it's good to be kind to the things and people that are not happy. Like the fly. You tried to help the fly, didn't you?" Lily nodded and said, "Yes, mom. But the fly was dead. I could not make it alive. I was sad."

Lily's mom hugged Lily and said, "I know, Lily. Sometimes things die and we can't do anything about it. It's okay to be sad. But it's also okay to be happy. Because you have a lot of things and people that love you. Like me. And dad. And your toys. And the cushion. And the sun. And the moon. And the stars. And many more. Can you say thank you to them, too?" Lily smiled and said, "Yes, mom. Thank you, mom. Thank you, dad. Thank you, toys. Thank you, cushion. Thank you, sun. Thank you, moon. Thank you, stars. Thank you, thank you, thank you."

Ben and Lily were friends who liked to play together. They had different skin colors: Ben's skin was brown and Lily's skin was white. They did not care about that. They cared about having fun.

One day, they went to the park with their moms. They saw a big slide and ran to it. Ben went first and slid down fast. He laughed and said, "That was fun! Come on, Lily!"

Lily climbed up the ladder and got ready to slide. But then she saw a boy with red hair and green eyes. He was waiting for his turn. He looked at Lily and said, "Hey, you have weird skin. What is your name?"

Lily felt sad and scared. She did not like the boy's words. She said, "My name is Lily. What is your name?"

The boy said, "My name is Max. And I have the best skin. It is red and green, like a firework. You have boring skin. It is white, like snow. I am envious of nothing."

Ben heard what Max said. He felt angry and brave. He climbed up the ladder and stood next to Lily. He said, "You are wrong, Max. Lily's skin is not boring. It is beautiful, like a flower. And my skin is not weird. It is cool, like chocolate. We have different skin, but we are both good. You are envious of everything."

Max did not know what to say. He felt ashamed and small. He ran away from the slide. Ben and Lily smiled at each other. They slid down together and hugged. They were happy and proud. Their moms saw them and clapped. They had the best skin. It was the skin of friends.

Lily and Tom were playing dress-up in their room. They had many clothes and hats and shoes to try on. They liked to pretend they were different people and animals. Lily put on a red dress and a big hat. She said, "I am a queen. You have to do what I say." Tom put on a blue shirt and a tie. He said, "I am a teacher. You have to learn what I teach."

They played for a long time, but then they heard their mom call them for dinner. They had to end their game and go downstairs. They started to take off their clothes and put them back in the closet. But Lily wanted to keep her hat. She said, "This is my hat. I want to wear it for dinner." Tom said, "No, you have to put it back. It is not yours. It is mom's hat. She will be mad if you take it."

They began to fight over the hat. They pulled and tugged and shouted. The hat fell to the floor. They both reached for it, but they knocked over a hanger. The hanger hit the lamp and the lamp fell down. It made a loud noise and broke. They both stopped and looked at the mess. They were scared and sorry.

Mom heard the noise and came upstairs. She saw the broken lamp and the clothes and the hat. She was not happy. She said, "What happened here? Why did you make such a mess? Why did you fight over the hat?" Lily and Tom hung their heads. They said, "We are sorry, mom. We were playing dress-up and we did not want to end. We both liked the hat and we did not share. We did not mean to break the lamp."

Mom sighed and said, "I understand you were having fun, but you have to be careful and respectful. The hat is mine and you have to ask me before you use it. The lamp is ours and you have to be gentle with it. The clothes are yours and you have to put them away. Now, help me clean up this mess and then we can go for dinner. And no more fighting, okay?"

Lily and Tom nodded and said, "Okay, mom. We are sorry. We will help you. We will not fight." They picked up the clothes and the hat and the hanger. They helped mom sweep the glass and fix the lamp. They hugged mom and said, "We love you, mom. You are the best." Mom smiled and said, "I love you too, Lily and Tom. You are the best too. Now, let's go and eat. I made your favorite soup." They went downstairs and ate their soup. They were calm and happy. They ended their day with a good night kiss.

Sara and Ben were very happy. They were going on a holiday with Mum and Dad. They packed their bags with toys and clothes. They went to the big place where the planes fly.

Mum and Dad had to weigh their bags. They put them on a big scale. The scale said how heavy the bags were. Mum and Dad had to pay money for the bags. Sara and Ben did not have to weigh their bags. They were small and light.

They got on the plane. The plane was very big and loud. Sara and Ben sat by the window. They saw the clouds and the birds. They ate some snacks and played some games. They were very excited.

But then the plane hit some bad air. The plane shook and bounced. Sara and Ben felt scared. They held Mum and Dad's hands. Mum and Dad said it was OK. They said it was just a little bump.

The plane landed in a new place. It was very cold and white. Sara and Ben saw snow and ice. They wore their warm coats and hats. They got off the plane. They felt a bitter wind on their faces. They shivered and hugged Mum and Dad.

They got in a car. The car took them to a nice house. The house had a fire and a tree. The tree had lights and balls. Sara and Ben smiled. They said it was a beautiful holiday. They forgot about the bad air and the bitter wind. They were happy again.

Ben and Sam were brothers. They liked to play in the cabin in the woods. The cabin was old and small, but it had many toys and books. Ben and Sam had fun with the toys and books.

One day, they heard a loud noise outside. They looked out the window and saw a big truck. The truck was red and shiny. It had a bald man driving it. The bald man got out of the truck and knocked on the door.

"Hello, boys," the bald man said. "I'm sorry to delay your play, but I need to talk to your dad. He asked me to fix the roof of the cabin. It has a hole and it leaks when it rains."

Ben and Sam were curious. They wanted to see the hole and the roof. They asked the bald man if they could help him.

"Sure, you can help me," the bald man said. "But you have to be careful. The roof is high and steep. You have to wear these helmets and gloves. And you have to listen to me and do what I say."

Ben and Sam nodded. They put on the helmets and gloves. They followed the bald man to the ladder. They climbed up the ladder and saw the hole. It was big and dark. The bald man had a hammer and some nails. He showed Ben and Sam how to fix the hole with some wood and tar.

Ben and Sam helped the bald man. They held the wood and the nails. They spread the tar. They hammered the nails. They worked hard and fast. They fixed the hole.

"Good job, boys," the bald man said. "You are very brave and smart. You helped me a lot. Now the roof is good and strong. It won't leak anymore."

Ben and Sam smiled. They were proud and happy. They thanked the bald man. They climbed down the ladder. They ran to the cabin. They told their dad what they did. Their dad hugged them and praised them. He gave them some cookies and milk. They ate the cookies and drank the milk. They went back to the cabin. They played with the toys and books. They had more fun.

Tom and Mia are friends. They like to play with toys. One day, Tom brings a new toy to Mia's house. It is a magnet. A magnet can stick to some things, like metal.

Tom and Mia have fun with the magnet. They stick it to Mia's fridge, her spoon, her car, and her bell. They make loud noises and laugh. Mia's mom smiles and says, "Welcome, Tom. I'm glad you came to play."

But after a while, Tom and Mia get tired. They yawn and rub their eyes. They want to take a nap. Mia's mom says, "You can sleep in Mia's room. She has a cozy bed and a soft pillow."

Tom and Mia go to Mia's room. They bring the magnet with them. They put it on Mia's nightstand, next to her lamp. They cuddle under the blanket and close their eyes. They dream of more things to stick with the magnet. They are happy.

Lila and Tom were playing with their toys in the garden. Lila had a big doll that she liked very much. Tom had a small car that he liked very much. They were happy and shared their toys.

But then, a big dog came and saw the toys. The dog ran and grabbed the doll with its mouth. Lila was scared and cried. "No, no, that is mine! Give it back!" she shouted. Tom tried to help her and threw a stick at the dog. But the dog did not care and ran away with the doll.

Lila and Tom ran after the dog. They saw the dog go into a house. They knocked on the door. A lady opened the door. She saw the dog with the doll. She saw Lila and Tom. She was angry and ashamed.

"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, this is my dog. He is naughty and likes to carry things. He did not mean to hurt you. Here, take your doll back. And here, have a cookie. I'm very sorry," she said.

Lila and Tom took their doll and their cookie. They thanked the lady and went back to the garden. They hugged their toys and each other. They were happy again. They learned to be careful with their toys and to forgive others.

Tom was a king. He had a big crown made of gold and jewels. He liked to wear his crown and sit on his throne. He felt very important and proud.

One day, he had to go to a party with other kings and queens. He wanted to show off his crown and make them jealous. He put on his best clothes and his crown and walked to his carriage.

But on the way, he did not see a stone on the ground. He stumbled and fell. His crown flew off his head and rolled away. He hurt his knee and his nose. He cried out loud.

"Help! Help! Where is my crown?" he shouted.

A girl who was passing by heard him. She saw his crown and picked it up. She ran to him and gave it back.

"Here is your crown, sir. Are you okay?" she asked.

Tom took his crown and looked at it. It was dirty and bent. Some of the jewels were missing. He felt miserable.

"Thank you, but my crown is ruined. It is not shiny and pretty anymore. The other kings and queens will laugh at me. I don't want to go to the party anymore," he said.

The girl felt sorry for him. She smiled and said, "Don't be sad, sir. Your crown is not the most important thing. You are still a king. You have a big heart and a kind voice. You can make people happy and help them. That is what makes you a good king. The other kings and queens will like you for who you are, not for what you wear."

Tom listened to her words. He wiped his tears and smiled back. He realized she was right. He thanked her and hugged her. He put on his crown and got on his carriage. He went to the party and had fun. He made new friends and learned new things. He was happy and proud. He never forgot the girl who helped him. He always remembered to be a good king.

Sara and Tom are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a big tree with a swing. Sara and Tom run to the swing. They take turns to push each other.

"Look, I can hang from the swing!" Sara says. She lets go of the rope and holds on with her hands.

"Wow, you are brave!" Tom says. He claps his hands.

Sara swings back and forth. She feels happy. She sees a bird on a branch. The bird sings a song.

"Hello, bird!" Sara says. "Do you want to play with us?"

The bird flies down and lands on Sara's shoulder. It pecks her ear gently.

"Hi, Sara!" the bird says. "You are kind. I like you."

Sara smiles. She strokes the bird's feathers.

"What is your name?" she asks.

"My name is Spirit," the bird says. "I am a magic bird. I can talk to children who are kind and have fun."

Sara and Tom are surprised. They have never met a magic bird before.

"Can we be your friends?" Tom asks.

"Of course!" Spirit says. "You are both kind and have fun. You have a good spirit. Come, let's play some more!"

Sara, Tom, and Spirit play on the swing, on the slide, and on the seesaw. They laugh and sing. They have a wonderful time. They are happy.

Tom and Anna are having lunch with Mom and Dad. They have soup and bread and cheese. Tom likes soup, but Anna does not. She makes a face and pushes her bowl away.

"Anna, you have to eat your soup. It is good for you," Mom says.

"I don't like soup. It is hot and wet and yucky," Anna says.

"Look, Anna, you can use your fork to eat the cheese. Cheese is yummy and soft and yellow," Dad says. He shows Anna how to cut the cheese with his fork.

Anna looks at Dad's fork. It is big and shiny and has four teeth. She likes Dad's fork. She reaches for it, but Dad stops her.

"No, Anna, this is my fork. You have your own fork. It is smaller and easier for you to hold," Dad says. He gives Anna her fork. It is not as big or shiny as Dad's fork. It has three teeth and a pink handle.

Anna looks at her fork. She does not like her fork. It is small and dull and has a silly color. She throws her fork on the floor and cries.

"Anna, that is not nice. You have to pick up your fork and say sorry," Mom says.

Anna does not want to pick up her fork or say sorry. She is angry and sad. She wants a big fork like Dad's. She thinks it is not fair.

Tom looks at Anna. He feels sorry for her. He likes his sister, even when she is silly. He has an idea. He picks up his fork and gives it to Anna.

"Here, Anna, you can have my fork. It is big and shiny and has four teeth, like Dad's. I don't mind. I can use my spoon to eat my soup," Tom says.

Anna looks at Tom's fork. She is surprised and happy. She takes Tom's fork and smiles.

"Thank you, Tom. You are a good brother. I am sorry I was mean," Anna says.

Mom and Dad look at Tom and Anna. They are proud and happy. They hug their children and praise them.

"That was very kind of you, Tom. You are a good sharer. And that was very nice of you, Anna. You are a good apologizer. We love you both very much," Mom and Dad say.

Tom and Anna hug Mom and Dad back. They love them too. They eat their lunch with their forks and spoons. They are a happy family.

Lily and Ben were best friends. They liked to play with their toys in the garden. One day, Lily brought a new doll. It had long hair and a pretty dress. Ben wanted to play with it.

"Can I see your doll?" Ben asked.

"OK, but be careful," Lily said. She gave him the doll.

Ben looked at the doll. He liked it very much. He wanted to keep it. He had an idea.

"Let's trade," he said. "You can have my car. It is fast and shiny."

Lily liked the car, but she loved her doll more. She shook her head.

"No, thank you. I want my doll back," she said.

Ben did not listen. He ran away with the doll. He hid it behind a bush. He thought Lily would not find it.

Lily was very sad. She wept. She looked for her doll. She could not see it.

"Ben, give me my doll. That is not nice," she cried.

Ben did not answer. He was happy with the doll. He did not care about Lily.

Lily wept louder. She wanted her doll. She wanted her friend.

A grown-up heard Lily. She came to the garden. She saw Lily weeping. She saw Ben hiding.

"What is wrong, Lily?" the grown-up asked.

"Ben took my doll. He traded it for his car. He hid it. I want my doll," Lily sobbed.

The grown-up frowned. She went to Ben. She found the doll behind the bush.

"Ben, that is not nice. You should not take Lily's doll. You should not trade without asking. You should not hide things. You should say sorry," the grown-up said.

Ben felt bad. He knew he was wrong. He gave the doll back to Lily.

"I am sorry, Lily. I was mean. Can we be friends again?" he said.

Lily smiled. She hugged her doll. She hugged Ben.

"I forgive you, Ben. We can be friends again. But next time, ask before you trade," she said.

The grown-up smiled. She was glad they made up. She gave them a cookie each.

They ate the cookies. They played with their toys. They shared and took turns. They were happy.

Tom and Sue were friends who liked to play in the big house. The big house had many rooms and doors and stairs. One day, they found a new door that was locked. They wanted to see what was inside.

"Maybe there is a treasure or a toy or a cake," Tom said.

"Or maybe there is a monster or a trap or a ghost," Sue said.

They looked for a key, but they could not find one. Then they saw a hole in the wall. It was big enough for them to crawl through.

"Let's go in and see," Tom said.

"I don't know, it looks dark and scary," Sue said.

But Tom was curious and brave, so he went in first. Sue followed him, because she did not want to be alone. They crawled through the hole and came out in a big chamber. It was dark and cold and dusty. There were many things in the chamber, but they were old and broken and dirty.

"This is not fun, this is boring," Tom said.

"Let's go back," Sue said.

But when they turned around, they saw that the hole was gone. It was covered by a big stone that fell from the ceiling. They were trapped in the chamber. They were helpless.

"Help! Help!" they shouted, but no one heard them.

They cried and hugged each other. They wished they had not gone in the chamber. They wished they had listened to Sue. They were sorry for being naughty and curious.

Then they heard a sound. It was a voice. It was coming from a small window in the wall.

"Hello, hello, are you there?" the voice said.

It was their friend Ben. He had seen them go in the hole and followed them. He had seen the stone fall and blocked the hole. He had looked for another way to get to them. He had found the window.

"Ben, Ben, we are here, we are here!" Tom and Sue said.

"Don't worry, I will help you," Ben said.

He ran to get a rope and a flashlight. He came back and threw the rope through the window. He told Tom and Sue to tie it around their waists. He pulled them out one by one. He gave them the flashlight and hugged them.

"Are you okay? Are you hurt?" he asked.

"We are okay, we are okay, thanks to you," Tom and Sue said.

They were happy and grateful. They thanked Ben for saving them. They said they were sorry for being foolish and reckless. They said they learned their lesson. They said they would never go in the chamber again. They said they would always listen to their friend.

Ben smiled and said, "You are welcome. I am glad you are safe. You are my friends. Friends help each other. Friends solve problems together. Friends are good."

The end.

Lily and Sam were playing with their trucks in the backyard. They liked to make noises and pretend they were driving on the road. Lily had a red truck and Sam had a blue truck.

"Look at my truck, it is so fast and strong!" Sam said, zooming his truck on the grass.

"My truck is faster and stronger!" Lily said, chasing Sam's truck with her own.

They raced and bumped their trucks until they reached the fence. There, they saw a big sign that said "Lemonade for sale". It was made by their neighbor, Ben, who had a table with a pitcher and some cups.

"Let's go get some lemonade, I am thirsty!" Sam said, leaving his truck by the fence.

"Me too!" Lily said, following Sam with her truck.

They ran to the table and saw Ben smiling. He had a big yellow hat and a green apron.

"Hi, Lily and Sam! Do you want some lemonade? It is only one penny a cup!" Ben said, holding a cup.

"Yes, please!" Lily and Sam said, giving Ben a penny each.

Ben poured them some lemonade and handed them the cups. Lily and Sam took a sip and made a face. The lemonade was very sour!

"Yuck! This lemonade is sour!" Lily said, spitting it out.

"Me too! It is not good!" Sam said, putting down his cup.

Ben looked sad. He had worked hard to make the lemonade, but he had put too much lemon and not enough sugar.

"I'm sorry, Lily and Sam. I wanted to make good lemonade, but I guess I made a mistake. Do you want your pennies back?" Ben said, reaching for his jar.

Lily and Sam looked at each other. They felt sorry for Ben. He was their friend and he had tried his best.

"No, Ben, it's okay. You can keep the pennies. Maybe you can try again another day." Lily said, smiling.

"Yeah, Ben, don't be sad. We still like you and your sign. It is very nice. You can display it again when you make better lemonade." Sam said, pointing at the sign.

Ben smiled back. He was glad that Lily and Sam were nice and did not get mad at him.

"Thank you, Lily and Sam. You are good friends. Do you want to play with me and my truck? I have a yellow truck that matches my hat." Ben said, showing them his truck.

"Sure, Ben, we would love to play with you and your truck. Let's go to the backyard and have some fun!" Lily said, grabbing her truck.

"Come on, Ben, let's go!" Sam said, picking up his truck.

They ran to the backyard, leaving the sour lemonade behind. They played with their trucks and had a good time. They forgot about the lemonade and were happy.

Ben and Mia love to swim in the sea. They have big masks and tubes to see the fish. One day, they see a big boat near the shore. The boat has many boxes on it.

"Let's go see the boat," Ben says. "Maybe they have something fun."

"OK," Mia says. "But we have to be careful. The boat might be bad."

They swim to the boat and look at the boxes. They see words on them. They do not know what they mean. They see a hole in one box. They peek inside. They see many shiny things.

"Wow," Ben says. "These are pretty. Can we take some?"

"I don't know," Mia says. "Maybe they belong to someone."

They hear a loud voice from the boat. It is a man. He is angry.

"Hey, you kids! Get away from there! That's my supply of jewels! I stole them from the reef! They are very valuable!"

Ben and Mia are scared. They drop the shiny things and swim away. The man tries to catch them, but he is too slow. He is crazy.

Ben and Mia reach the shore. They are safe. They hug each other.

"That was scary," Ben says. "We should not go near the boat again."

"Yes," Mia says. "The boat is bad. The man is bad. The shiny things are bad. They hurt the reef and the fish."

They decide to swim in another place. They find a nice reef with many colors and shapes. They see many friendly fish. They are happy. They forget about the boat and the crazy man. They have fun.

Lily and Tom were friends who liked to play with loops. Loops were round things that you could roll, spin, or wear. They had many loops of different colors and sizes. One day, they received a big box from their aunt. Inside the box, there were many new loops that they had never seen before.

"Wow, look at these loops!" Lily said. "They are so shiny and pretty. Can we play with them?"

"Of course we can!" Tom said. "Let's see what they can do."

They opened the box and took out the loops. Some of the loops had bells, some had beads, some had ribbons, and some had lights. They tried to roll, spin, and wear the loops, but they did not work well. The bells made too much noise, the beads fell off, the ribbons got tangled, and the lights hurt their eyes.

"These loops are not fun," Lily said. "They are too different from our old loops. I want to play with our old loops."

"Me too," Tom said. "Let's put these loops back in the box and play with our old loops."

They put the new loops back in the box and went to look for their old loops. But they could not find them. They looked everywhere, but they were gone.

"Where are our old loops?" Lily asked. "Did someone take them?"

"Maybe the aunt took them," Tom said. "Maybe she wanted to trade them for the new loops."

"That's not fair!" Lily said. "We did not want to trade our old loops. We liked our old loops. They were our favorite loops."

They started to cry. They wished they had not opened the box. They wished they had not played with the new loops. They wished they had kept their old loops.

The moral of the story is: Be careful what you wish for. Sometimes, the things that seem new and exciting are not as good as the things that you already have. You should appreciate what you have and not be greedy for what you don't.

Tom and Jen like to play with their toy cars. They have a big stadium where they can race and crash their cars. They pretend they are drivers and fans and make loud noises.

One day, Tom's car breaks. The wheel falls off and the car stops. Tom is sad and angry. He throws his car on the floor and cries.

"Tom, don't cry," Jen says. "We can fix your car. I have glue and tape. Come, let's go to the table and fix it."

Tom and Jen go to the table and find the glue and tape. Jen puts some glue on the wheel and sticks it back to the car. Then she wraps some tape around it to make it stronger.

"There, your car is fixed," Jen says. "Let's go back to the stadium and race again."

Tom smiles and hugs Jen. He is happy and thankful. He picks up his car and runs to the stadium. He and Jen race and crash their cars again. They have fun and forget about the scary broken car. They are good friends.

Ben and Lily were playing in the park. They liked to swing, slide and run. But they also liked to look for bugs. They had a jar with holes in the lid. They put some grass and leaves in the jar. Then they searched for bugs to put in the jar.

"Look, Lily, I found a green bug!" Ben said. He showed Lily a small beetle with shiny green wings. "It is so pretty! Can we keep it?"

Lily nodded. She liked the green bug too. She opened the jar and Ben put the bug inside. They closed the lid and shook the jar gently. The bug crawled on the grass and leaves.

"Let's find more bugs!" Lily said. She ran to a flower bed and looked for more bugs. Ben followed her.

They found a red bug, a yellow bug, a black bug and a blue bug. They put them all in the jar. They were happy. They had a lot of bugs.

But then they heard a loud buzz. A big bee flew near them. It saw the jar with the bugs. It wanted to see the bugs too. It flew to the jar and tried to get in. It pushed the lid with its head.

"Go away, bee!" Ben said. He waved his hand at the bee. "These are our bugs! You can't have them!"

But the bee did not go away. It was angry. It stung Ben on his lip. Ben cried out. His lip hurt. It was red and swollen.

Lily saw Ben's lip. She felt sorry for him. She hugged him. She said, "I'm sorry, Ben. The bee was mean. Let's go to mom. She will make your lip better."

Ben nodded. He held Lily's hand. They took the jar with the bugs. They ran to their mom. She was sitting on a bench. She saw Ben's lip. She said, "Oh, Ben, what happened? Did a bee sting you?"

Ben nodded. He said, "Yes, mom. The bee wanted our bugs. We found a lot of bugs. Look, mom, we have a green bug!"

Mom smiled. She said, "You have a lot of bugs. They are very pretty. But you have to be careful with bees. They can sting you. Let me see your lip."

Mom took a tissue and put some ice on Ben's lip. She said, "This will make your lip feel better. It will go down soon. Don't worry."

Ben felt better. He said, "Thank you, mom. You are the best."

Mom said, "You're welcome, Ben. You are very brave. Now, why don't you and Lily settle on the grass and watch your bugs? Maybe they will do something funny."

Ben and Lily settled on the grass. They watched their bugs. They saw the green bug fly, the red bug crawl, the yellow bug jump, the black bug hide and the blue bug shine. They laughed. They were happy. They forgot about the bee. They had fun with their bugs.

Tom and Mia are friends. They like to play together. Today, Tom goes to visit Mia at her house. He brings his toy car and his hat.

"Hi, Tom!" Mia says. "Do you want to play with me?"

"Yes, please!" Tom says. He puts his hat on the table and his car on the floor. "What do you want to play?"

Mia thinks for a moment. She has an idea. "Let's play tea party!" she says. She takes two cups and a pitcher from her toy box. She fills the pitcher with juice. "This is our tea," she says.

Tom nods. He likes juice. He takes a cup and holds it out. Mia pours some juice into his cup. "Thank you," Tom says. He takes a sip. The juice is sweet and cold.

Mia pours some juice into her cup, too. She raises it to her lips. But then, she sneezes. Achoo! The juice spills out of her cup and onto her dress. She gasps. Her dress is wet and sticky.

"Oh, no!" Tom says. He puts his cup down and gets a napkin. He tries to help Mia wipe the juice off her dress. But the napkin is too small. The juice makes a big stain.

Mia starts to cry. She does not like her wet dress. She feels sad and messy.

"Don't cry, Mia," Tom says. He hugs her. "It's okay. It was an accident. You can change your dress."

Mia sniffles. She looks at Tom. He is a good friend. He makes her feel better. She hugs him back. "Thank you, Tom," she says. "You are very nice."

Tom smiles. He is happy to help Mia. He likes to play with her. He does not mind the juice. He thinks it is funny. He laughs. "You're welcome, Mia," he says. "You are very nice, too."

Anna liked to wake up early and watch the sunrise. She liked how the sky changed colors and how the birds sang. She liked to sit on the window and feel the warm sun on her face. But she was lonely. She wished she had someone to share the sunrise with.

One day, she saw a boy walking on the street. He had a big backpack and a funny hat. He looked up and saw Anna on the window. He smiled and waved at her. Anna smiled and waved back. She felt happy. She wanted to talk to him.

She ran to the door and opened it. She called out to the boy. "Hi! What is your name? Do you want to see the sunrise with me?"

The boy stopped and looked at her. He said, "Hi! My name is Ben. I am going to school. I like the sunrise, but I have to mind the time. I don't want to be late."

Anna felt sad. She said, "Oh. I don't go to school. I stay at home with my mom. She is sick and needs me. I don't have any friends. I am lonely."

Ben felt sorry for her. He said, "I am sorry. That is hard. I have an idea. Why don't you come with me to school? You can meet my friends and learn new things. Maybe you will like it. And you can still see the sunrise on the way."

Anna liked the idea. She said, "Yes, please. That sounds fun. Thank you, Ben. You are very kind. Can I bring my mom?"

Ben said, "Of course. She can come too. Maybe she will feel better. Come on, let's go. The sunrise is waiting for us."

Anna and Ben held hands and walked to school. They saw the sunrise together. They saw the sky change colors and heard the birds sing. They felt the warm sun on their faces. They were not lonely anymore. They were happy. They had found a friend.

Anna and Ben are playing in the park. They see a large dog with brown fur and a red bow on its neck. The dog is friendly and wags its tail.

"Hello, dog!" Anna says. "You are very pretty. Can I pet you?"

The dog nods and licks Anna's hand. Ben is scared of the dog. He hides behind a tree.

"Ben, don't be afraid," Anna says. "The dog is nice. Come and say hi."

Ben shakes his head. He does not want to go near the dog. He sees a shiny purse on the bench. The purse is pink and has flowers on it.

"Look, Anna, a purse!" Ben says. "Maybe it has something inside."

Ben runs to the bench and grabs the purse. He opens it and finds a cookie, a ball, and a whistle.

"Wow, this is a great purse!" Ben says. "I want to keep it."

The dog barks and runs after Ben. The dog wants the purse too. The dog jumps on Ben and knocks him down. The purse falls on the ground and the cookie, the ball, and the whistle roll out.

"Hey, stop it!" Ben cries. "This is my purse!"

The dog picks up the cookie with its mouth and eats it. The dog also plays with the ball and the whistle.

"Bad dog!" Ben says. "Give me back my things!"

Anna comes to help Ben. She sees a lady running towards them. The lady is wearing a blue dress and a hat. The lady is the owner of the dog and the purse.

"Spot, come here!" the lady says. "I'm sorry, kids, he took my purse. He likes to chew on things."

The lady takes the purse and the whistle from the dog. She gives the ball to Ben and the cookie to Anna.

"Here, you can have these," the lady says. "I'm sorry for the trouble. Spot is a good dog, but he is very curious."

The lady puts the bow back on the dog's neck and walks away. The dog wags its tail and says goodbye.

"Bye, dog!" Anna says. "You are very funny. Thank you for the cookie."

Ben is still angry. He does not like the dog. He does not like the ball. He wants the purse.

"Anna, let's go home," Ben says. "I don't want to play here anymore."

Anna nods and follows Ben. She likes the cookie. She likes the dog. She thinks the purse is too big for her. She is happy.

Lily and Ben were excited to go to the lake with their dad. They liked to swim, splash and play with the fish. They also liked to find logs and sticks to make boats and rafts.

"Look, dad, I found a big log!" Ben shouted, dragging a long piece of wood to the shore. "Can we make a boat with it?"

"Sure, Ben, that's a great log for a boat. Let's see if we can find some rope and a sail," dad said, smiling.

Lily ran to help Ben with the log. She saw a blue towel and a stick nearby. "I have an idea, Ben. We can use this towel as a sail and this stick as a mast. Then we can tie them to the log with this rope," she said, holding up the items.

"Wow, Lily, you are very smart. That's a good idea. Let's do it," Ben said, nodding.

They worked together to make the boat. They tied the rope around the log and the stick. They attached the towel to the stick with some knots. They made sure the boat was strong and stable.

"Are you ready, Ben?" Lily asked, holding the boat.

"Yes, I'm ready, Lily. Let's send our boat to the water," Ben said, grabbing the other end of the boat.

They lifted the boat and carried it to the edge of the lake. They counted to three and pushed the boat into the water. The boat floated and the wind blew the sail.

"Look, dad, look! Our boat is sailing!" Lily and Ben shouted, jumping and clapping.

"Wow, you two, you made a wonderful boat. I'm very proud of you. Let's watch it go," dad said, hugging them.

Sara likes to read books. She has many books in her room. She reads them every day. She reads about animals, and cars, and stars.

One day, Sara finds a new book in her room. It is a big book with a shiny cover. She opens it and sees many pictures. She sees a picture of a chain. A chain is a long thing with many round parts. She reads the words under the picture. The words say: "A chain can be used to pull, to lock, or to make noise."

Sara wants to try the chain. She looks around her room. She sees her toy box. She sees a lock on her toy box. She thinks: "Maybe I can use the chain to open the lock." She takes the chain and puts it around the lock. She pulls the chain hard. The lock does not open. She pulls harder. The lock still does not open. She pulls harder and harder. The chain breaks. The lock falls to the floor. Sara is sad. She says: "Oh no, I broke the chain. Now I can't read the book anymore."

Sara hears a noise. She turns around. She sees her mom. Her mom is smiling. She says: "Sara, what are you doing? I brought you a new book. It is a book about chains. I thought you would like it." Sara is surprised. She says: "Mom, this is the book I was reading. I found it in my room. I tried to use the chain to open the lock, but I broke the chain. I'm sorry, mom." Her mom hugs her. She says: "It's okay, Sara. The chain was old and weak. It was not a good chain. I have a new chain for you. It is a strong chain. You can use it to play, but not to open locks. And you can still read the book. The book is not broken. It is a good book. I love you, Sara." Sara smiles. She says: "I love you too, mom. Thank you for the book and the chain. Can we read the book together?" Her mom says: "Of course, Sara. Let's read the book together. It is a warm day. We can read the book in the garden. Come on, Sara. Let's go." Sara takes the book and the chain. She follows her mom. She is happy. She likes to read books. She likes to learn new things. She likes to be with her mom.

Anna liked to play with her cute doll. She named her doll Lily and gave her a pink dress and a hat. Anna and Lily did everything together. They had tea parties, read books, and sang songs.

One day, Anna and Lily went to the park with Mommy. Anna saw a big slide and wanted to try it. She put Lily on the grass and ran to the slide. She climbed up the ladder and slid down with a big smile. She felt happy and proud.

But when she went back to the grass, Lily was gone. Anna looked everywhere, but she could not find her doll. She felt sad and scared. She started to cry and called for Mommy.

Mommy came and hugged Anna. She asked her what was wrong. Anna told her that Lily disappeared. Mommy helped Anna look for Lily. They searched the park, but they could not see her.

Then, Mommy noticed a small crack in the fence. She peeked through the crack and saw Lily on the other side. She was lying on the dirt, next to a trash can. Mommy reached through the crack and grabbed Lily. She gave her back to Anna.

Anna was so happy to see Lily. She hugged her and kissed her. She thanked Mommy for finding her. She said she was sorry for leaving her alone. She promised to never lose her again.

Mommy smiled and said it was okay. She said she was glad they found Lily. She said they should go home and wash her. She said Lily was a very cute doll. Anna agreed and nodded. She held Lily tight and walked with Mommy. She felt happy and safe.

Lily liked balloons. She liked to blow them up and tie them. She liked to make them fly and bounce. She liked to play with them with her friends.

But Max did not like balloons. He was scared of them. He thought they were loud and mean. He did not like to see them or touch them. He hated when Lily played with them.

One day, Lily brought a big red balloon to school. She was very happy. She showed it to her friends and they smiled. But Max saw the balloon and he was very worried. He wanted the balloon to go away.

He had an idea. He found a sharp stick and he hid it in his hand. He walked up to Lily and her friends. He pretended to be nice. He said hello and asked to see the balloon.

Lily was surprised. She did not know Max wanted to play. She was kind and she gave him the balloon. She hoped he would like it.

But Max did not like it. He held the balloon and he poked it with the stick. The balloon popped with a loud bang. Lily and her friends screamed and jumped. Max laughed and ran away.

Lily was very sad. She liked her balloon and she wanted to play with it. She did not understand why Max did that. She felt angry and hurt. She cried and hugged her friends.

Max was not happy. He thought he would feel better after he popped the balloon. But he did not. He felt guilty and mean. He saw Lily crying and he felt sorry. He wished he did not poke the balloon. He wished he was nice.

Sara and Ben like to play outside. But today, the sky is gray and the rain is falling. Sara and Ben are sad. They want to have fun.

They look for a place to play. They see a big tree. The tree has many leaves. The leaves keep the rain away. Sara and Ben run to the tree. They find a hole under the tree. The hole is hidden by the roots. Sara and Ben crawl into the hole.

Inside the hole, Sara and Ben are happy. They have a secret place. They can play and talk and laugh. They do not care about the rain. They keep each other warm and cozy. They pretend they are animals or pirates or fairies. They have many stories to tell.

The rain stops. The sun comes out. Sara and Ben hear their mom calling. They crawl out of the hole. They run to their mom. They hug her and tell her about their adventure. Their mom smiles and listens. She is glad they had fun. She is glad they are safe. She is glad they are her children.

Anna and Ben are friends. They like to play in the park. They run, jump, slide and swing. They have fun.

But one day, Ben is not in the park. Anna waits and waits, but he does not come. She feels lonely. She does not want to play by herself.

She sees a lady with a dog. The dog is big and brown. It has a red collar. The lady says, "Hello, little girl. Do you want to pet my dog? His name is Rex."

Anna likes dogs. She nods and smiles. She walks to the lady and the dog. She pauses. She is a little scared. The dog is bigger than her.

The lady says, "Don't worry. Rex is very friendly. He likes children. He won't bite. He just wants to say hello."

Anna reaches out her hand. The dog sniffs it. He licks it. He wags his tail. Anna giggles. She pets the dog. She feels happy.

The lady says, "You are very brave. Do you want to join us for lunch? I have some sandwiches and cookies. Rex has some bones and water."

Anna says, "Yes, please. Thank you. Can I call my mom first?"

The lady says, "Of course. Where is your mom?"

Anna says, "She is at home. She is working. She said I can play in the park until noon."

The lady says, "OK. Let's go to that bench. You can use my phone to call your mom. Then we can have lunch together."

Anna says, "OK. Thank you. You are very nice. And Rex is very cute."

The lady says, "You are very welcome. And you are very sweet. I'm glad we met. Maybe we can see each other again."

Anna says, "Yes, maybe. I hope so. Maybe Ben can come too. He is my friend. He likes dogs too."

The lady says, "That would be nice. Maybe we can be friends too."

Anna says, "Yes, we can. Friends are good."

They walk to the bench. They call Anna's mom. They have lunch. They talk and laugh. They are not lonely anymore.

Sara and Ben like to play with colors. They have many crayons and papers. They make pictures of animals, flowers, and cars. Sometimes they paint on the wall, but Mommy does not like that. She says they have to be careful and not make a mess.

One day, Sara and Ben see a big truck outside their house. It has many cans of paint and brushes. A man gets out of the truck. He is a painter. He comes to their door and talks to Mommy. He says he will paint their house a new color. Mommy says yes and shows him the house.

Sara and Ben are curious. They want to see the painter work. They follow him to the back of the house. He opens a can of paint. It is blue. He dips his brush in the paint and starts to paint the wall. Sara and Ben think it looks pretty. They want to help.

They find some crayons and papers. They draw pictures of the painter and the house. They use blue, yellow, and red. They make the pictures wild and fun. They show them to the painter. He smiles and says they are very good. He says they are artists.

Sara and Ben are happy. They thank the painter for his nice words. They give him their pictures as a gift. He thanks them and says he will keep them. He says they are his friends. Sara and Ben hug him and say they are his friends too. They go back to Mommy and tell her about the painter. Mommy says they are very sweet and polite. She says she is proud of them. Sara and Ben smile and hug Mommy. They like the painter and the new color of their house.

Tom likes to shine his shoes. He has black shoes that he wears to school. He wants them to look nice and smooth. He gets a newspaper from his dad and puts it on the floor. He gets a brush and some polish from his mom and starts to shine his shoes.

He rubs the polish on his shoes with the brush. He makes small circles with the brush. He sees the polish make his shoes shiny and smooth. He smiles and says, "Look, mom, look, dad, my shoes are shiny and smooth!"

His mom and dad look at his shoes and say, "Wow, Tom, your shoes are very shiny and smooth! You did a good job shining them. You are a good boy."

Tom feels happy and proud. He thanks his mom and dad for the polish and the brush. He picks up the newspaper and throws it in the trash. He puts on his shoes and says, "I'm ready for school. Bye, mom, bye, dad!"

He goes out the door and walks to the bus stop. He sees his friends and says, "Hi, friends, look at my shoes. They are shiny and smooth!"

His friends look at his shoes and say, "Wow, Tom, your shoes are very shiny and smooth! You have nice shoes. How did you shine them?"

Tom tells them about the newspaper, the brush and the polish. He says, "You can shine your shoes too. It is easy and fun. You just need a newspaper, a brush and some polish."

His friends say, "That sounds cool. We want to shine our shoes too. Can you show us how?"

Tom says, "Sure, I can show you how. Come to my house after school. We can shine our shoes together."

His friends say, "OK, that sounds fun. Thank you, Tom. You are a good friend."

Tom says, "You're welcome, friends. You are good friends too."

They get on the bus and go to school. They have a good day. They learn new things. They play and laugh. They are happy. They have shiny and smooth shoes.

Sara and Tom are twins. They like to visit their grandpa. He is a great man. He has a big house with a garden. He tells them stories and plays with them.

One day, they go to visit grandpa with their mom. They knock on the door. Grandpa opens it and smiles. He hugs them and says, "Hello, my little ones. I'm so happy to see you. Come in, come in."

They go inside and see a big cake on the table. It has candles and frosting. Grandpa says, "It's my birthday today. I made a cake for us. Do you want some?"

Sara and Tom clap their hands and say, "Yes, please. Happy birthday, grandpa. We love you."

They sit down and eat the cake. It is yummy. They sing a song for grandpa. He blows out the candles and makes a wish. He says, "My wish is to have more days like this. You are the best gift I ever had."

Sara and Tom hug him and say, "You are the best grandpa ever. We are glad you are our grandpa."

They spend the afternoon playing and talking. They have a lot of fun. They are happy to visit their grandpa. He is a great man.

Lily was a little girl who liked to play dress-up. She had many clothes and hats and shoes in her big sack. She liked to pretend she was a princess or a fairy or a doctor. One day, she found a veil in her sack. It was white and shiny and had flowers on it. Lily put it on her head and felt very pretty.

She wanted to show her veil to her friends. She ran outside with her sack and her veil. She saw Anna and Ben playing with a ball. She called them and said, "Look at my veil! Isn't it lovely?" Anna and Ben looked at her and smiled. They said, "Yes, it is very lovely. Can we try it on?" Lily said, "No, it is mine. You can't have it." She hugged her sack and her veil and ran away.

She saw Tom and Mia playing with a doll. She called them and said, "Look at my veil! Isn't it wonderful?" Tom and Mia looked at her and nodded. They said, "Yes, it is very wonderful. Can we see it?" Lily said, "No, it is mine. You can't touch it." She hugged her sack and her veil and ran away.

She saw Sam and Zoe playing with a puzzle. She called them and said, "Look at my veil! Isn't it amazing?" Sam and Zoe looked at her and frowned. They said, "Yes, it is very amazing. But why are you so mean? You don't want to share with anyone. You are not a good friend." Lily said, "No, you are not good friends. You want to take my veil. It is mine. You can't have it." She hugged her sack and her veil and ran away.

She ran and ran until she reached a big tree. She sat under the tree and looked at her veil. She felt very lonely and sad. She wished she had someone to play with. She wished she had someone to tell her how pretty she was. She wished she had someone to hug her and make her happy. She realized she had been very selfish and rude. She had hurt her friends' feelings. She had been fearful of losing her veil, but she had lost something more important: her friends.

She decided to go back and say sorry to her friends. She hoped they would forgive her and play with her again. She put her veil back in her sack and ran back to where she had seen them. She saw them playing together and having fun. She felt very sorry and ashamed. She went to them and said, "I am sorry, friends. I was very mean and silly. I don't want to keep my veil to myself. I want to share it with you. You can try it on and see how lovely you are. You can play with it and have fun. You are more precious to me than my veil. Will you be my friends again?" Her friends looked at her and smiled. They said, "We are happy you are sorry, Lily. We forgive you and we love you. You are a good friend. We are glad you want to share your veil with us. It is very kind of you. You are very lovely, too. Come and play with us." They hugged her and took turns wearing the veil. They played and laughed and had a good time. Lily felt very happy and grateful. She learned that sharing is caring and that friends are more valuable than things.

Sara and Ben like to watch videos on the big screen. They have many videos of animals, songs and stories. Sometimes they share the videos, and sometimes they want different ones.

One day, Sara wants to watch a video of a princess, but Ben wants to watch a video of a dinosaur. They both grab the same video and pull hard. The video tears in half and makes a loud noise. Sara and Ben start to cry.

Mom hears the noise and comes to see what happened. She sees the broken video and the sad children. She is not happy. She says, "Sara and Ben, you should not tear the video. That is not nice. You should be modest and take turns. Now you cannot watch any video today. Go to your rooms and think about what you did."

Sara and Ben feel sorry. They say, "We are sorry, Mom. We did not mean to tear the video. We just wanted to watch it. Can we say sorry to each other and hug?"

Mom smiles and says, "That is a good idea. You can say sorry and hug, and then you can play with your toys. Maybe tomorrow you can watch a new video, if you are modest and share."

Sara and Ben say sorry and hug. They go to their rooms and play with their toys. They learn to be modest and share. They are happy again.

Tim and Sam are friends. They like to watch cartoons on TV. They sit on the couch and talk about the cartoons.

"Look, Sam, it's the dog and the cat!" Tim says. "They are funny. The dog is big and the cat is small."

"Yes, Tim, they are funny. The dog is silly and the cat is smart." Sam says. "They always chase each other and make noises."

They laugh and clap their hands. They watch the cartoons for a long time.

Then, Tim's mom comes in. She sees Tim and Sam on the couch. She sees the TV. She is not happy.

"Tim, Sam, you have watched enough cartoons. It's time to go outside and play." She says. "You need some sun and fresh air. You look pale."

Tim and Sam do not want to go outside. They want to watch more cartoons. They make sad faces.

"But mom, we like the cartoons. They are fun. Can we watch a little more?" Tim says.

"No, Tim, you can't. You have watched too much. You need to move and run and jump. That's good for you." She says. "Come on, put on your shoes and jackets. I'll take you to the park. You can play with other kids and have fun."

Tim and Sam sigh. They turn off the TV. They put on their shoes and jackets. They follow Tim's mom to the car. They hope they can watch more cartoons later.

Jill and Ben like to play in the park. They see a big slide and run to it. Jill goes first. She climbs up the steps and sits on the slide. She slides down fast and laughs. Ben follows her. He slides down too and smiles.

They see a man with a big pink balloon. The balloon is filled with gas. The man gives the balloon to Jill and Ben. They say thank you and hold the balloon. The balloon is light and floats in the air.

They want to play with the balloon. They try to balance the balloon on their heads, their hands, and their feet. They giggle and have fun. But the wind is strong. It blows the balloon away from them. They chase the balloon. They run and jump and try to catch it.

But the balloon flies higher and higher. It goes over the trees and the houses. Jill and Ben can't reach it. They stop and look at the balloon. They feel sad. They lose their balloon.

They go back to the slide. They slide down again and again. They forget about the balloon. They have fun. They are happy.

Lily liked to create things with her crayons and paper. She made pictures of flowers, stars, and animals. One day, she wanted to create something new. She looked at a book and saw a picture of a shrimp. It was pink and had many legs and a long tail. Lily thought it looked funny and cute.

She took a pink crayon and started to draw a shrimp on her paper. She gave it big eyes, a smile, and some dots. She was happy with her creation. She showed it to her mom and said, "Look, mom, I made a shrimp!"

Mom smiled and said, "That's very nice, Lily. What is your shrimp's name?"

Lily thought for a moment and said, "His name is Bob. He is a friendly shrimp."

Mom nodded and said, "That's a good name. Do you want to hang your shrimp on the fridge?"

Lily nodded and said, "Yes, please. I want everyone to see Bob."

Mom helped Lily to hang her shrimp on the fridge with a magnet. Lily was proud of her shrimp. She said, "Bye, Bob. I'll see you later."

But when Lily came back from playing outside, she saw that her shrimp was gone. She looked around and saw her brother, Tom, holding her paper. He had torn it into pieces and was laughing. He said, "Your shrimp is silly and ugly. I don't like it. I made it better."

Lily felt sad and angry. She said, "No, you didn't. You ruined it. That was my shrimp. His name was Bob. He was friendly. You are mean and fierce. Give me back my shrimp."

Tom said, "No, I won't. It's mine now. Go away."

Lily ran to mom and told her what Tom did. Mom was not happy. She said, "Tom, that was not nice. You should not take and destroy Lily's things. You should apologize and make it up to her."

Tom said, "But I don't like her shrimp. It's stupid."

Mom said, "It doesn't matter if you like it or not. It was her creation. She worked hard on it and she loved it. You should respect her feelings and her work. How would you feel if someone did that to your things?"

Tom thought for a while and realized that he would feel bad if someone did that to his things. He said, "I'm sorry, Lily. I was wrong. I shouldn't have taken and torn your shrimp. Can I help you make a new one?"

Lily said, "It's okay, Tom. I forgive you. Yes, you can help me make a new one. Maybe we can make a friend for Bob."

Tom said, "Okay, let's do that. What should we name him?"

Lily said, "How about Tim?"

Tom said, "That sounds good. Let's go get some crayons and paper."

Mom smiled and said, "That's very nice of you, Tom. I'm proud of you. And I'm proud of you, Lily. You are very creative and kind. You both learned a valuable lesson today. You should always treat others the way you want to be treated."

The end.

Tim and Lily were playing in the park with their ball. They liked to kick the ball to each other and run after it. Sometimes they missed the ball and it rolled away. They had to be careful not to lose the ball or hit someone with it.

One time, the ball went too far and landed near a lady who was sitting on a bench. She had a big hat and a book. She looked up and saw the ball. She smiled and picked it up.

"Hello, children," she said. "Is this your ball?"

"Yes, it is," Tim said. "We are sorry. We did not mean to bother you."

"That's all right," the lady said. "You can have your ball back. But please be careful where you kick it. There are other people and animals in the park. You don't want to hurt them or make them angry."

"OK, we will," Lily said. "Thank you, lady."

The lady gave them the ball and they said goodbye. They ran back to their spot and decided to play a different game. They agreed to settle for catch instead of kick. They threw the ball to each other and caught it with their hands. They had fun and were careful not to let the ball go too far again. They liked the lady and hoped to see her again.

Ben and Lily were playing with their toy cars in the garden. They liked to make them zoom on the grass and the dirt. They had many cars of different colors and sizes.

"Look at my orange car!" Ben said. "It is very fast and loud. Zoom, zoom, zoom!"

Lily looked at Ben's car and wanted to play with it. She reached out her hand and grabbed it. "I want to play with the orange car!" she said.

Ben was angry. He did not like to share his car. He pulled it back and shouted. "No, it is my car! You have your own car. Give it back!"

Lily was angry too. She did not want to give back the car. She held it tight and cried. "No, it is mine now! You have many cars. I only have one!"

They both started to tug and yell. They did not hear their mom calling them from the house.

"Ben, Lily, what is going on?" mom said. She came to the garden and saw them fighting over the car. She was not happy. She took the car from them and put it on the table. "You two need to learn to share and be nice. No one can play with the car until you say sorry to each other."

Ben and Lily looked at each other. They felt bad for making mom angry and for hurting each other. They said sorry and hugged. Mom smiled and gave them a hug too. She gave them each a cookie and a glass of milk. She said they could play with the car together if they promised to take turns and be kind.

Ben and Lily agreed. They thanked mom and went back to the garden. They played with the car and their other toys. They made them zoom and laugh. They were happy and had fun.

Lily was very happy today. She was going to do a great class with her friends. The class was about animals. Lily loved animals. She had a dog at home. His name was Spot.

She put on her pink dress and her shoes. She took her backpack and her lunch box. She said bye to her mom and dad. They gave her a hug and a kiss. They said, "Have fun, Lily. Learn a lot. We are proud of you."

Lily got on the bus with her friends. They sang songs and played games. They were very excited. They saw the teacher waiting for them at the zoo. The teacher smiled and said, "Hello, children. Welcome to the animal class. Today we are going to see and learn about many different animals. Are you ready?"

The children said, "Yes, teacher. We are ready." They followed the teacher to the first cage. They saw a big lion. He had a mane and sharp teeth. He roared loudly. The children were scared. They hid behind the teacher. The teacher said, "Don't worry, children. The lion can't hurt you. He is behind the bars. He is just saying hello. Can you say hello to the lion?"

Lily was brave. She stepped forward and said, "Hello, lion. You are very big and strong. But I am not afraid of you. I have a dog at home. He is my friend. He barks and wags his tail. Do you have a friend, lion?" The lion looked at Lily and blinked. He stopped roaring. He licked his paw and rubbed his head. He seemed to like Lily. He nodded and said, "Yes, I have a friend. She is a lioness. She is in the next cage. She is very beautiful and smart. She hunts and plays with me. We are happy together." Lily smiled and said, "That's great, lion. I'm happy for you. Can I see your friend?" The lion said, "Of course. Come with me. I'll show you." He walked to the next cage and called his friend. The lioness came and greeted Lily and the other children. They were amazed and curious. They asked the lion and the lioness many questions. They learned a lot about them. They thanked them and said goodbye. They went to see the other animals. They had a great time. They did a great class. Lily was very happy. She made a new friend. She couldn't wait to tell her mom and dad. She thought, "This is the best day ever."

Lily and Ben were playing in the tent in the backyard. They had a flashlight and some toys. They liked to pretend they were camping in the woods.

"Look, I have a bear!" Ben said, holding up a stuffed animal. "He is big and brown and soft."

"I have a bunny!" Lily said, showing her toy. "She is small and white and cute."

They hugged their toys and smiled. They turned on the flashlight and made shadows on the tent wall.

Suddenly, they heard a loud noise outside. It sounded like thunder. They saw a flash of light. It was lightning.

Lily and Ben were scared. They dropped their toys and held each other. The flashlight flickered and went out. It was dark and noisy.

"Mommy! Daddy!" they cried. "Help us!"

Their parents heard them and ran to the tent. They opened the flap and saw their children crying.

"Shh, it's okay, we're here," Mommy said, hugging them. "It's just a storm. It will pass soon."

Daddy picked up the flashlight and shook it. It didn't work.

"Sorry, kids, this flashlight is cheap. It broke," he said. "But don't worry, we have another one in the house. Come on, let's go inside and have some hot chocolate."

Lily and Ben nodded. They grabbed their toys and followed their parents. They felt better when they saw the lights and felt the warmth of the house.

They still didn't like the storm, but they knew they were safe and loved.

Lily was sick. She had a bad cough and a sore throat. She did not want to play or eat. She only wanted to sleep. Her mom was worried. She gave Lily a pill to make her feel better. But Lily did not like the pill. It was big and bitter. She spit it out.

"Please, Lily, you have to take the pill," her mom said. "It will help you get well soon."

"No, no, no!" Lily cried. "I don't want the pill. It's yucky!"

Her mom tried to be patient. She hugged Lily and said, "I know, sweetie, but it's good for you. How about this? If you take the pill, I will let you watch your favorite show. The one with the lovely princess and the funny dragon. You love that show, don't you?"

Lily thought for a moment. She did love that show. It always made her laugh and smile. She wanted to see the princess and the dragon. Maybe the pill was not so bad after all. She nodded and said, "Okay, mom, I will take the pill. But only if you let me watch the show."

Her mom smiled and said, "Deal." She gave Lily a glass of water and the pill. Lily swallowed the pill quickly and made a face. Then she ran to the couch and turned on the TV. Her mom joined her and cuddled with her. They watched the show together and laughed and smiled. Lily felt a little better. She was glad she took the pill. And she was glad her mom let her watch the show. She loved her mom very much.

Lily and Tom are friends. They like to play with toys and eat snacks. One day, they go to Lily's house after school. Lily's mom gives them tuna sandwiches and apple juice. They are happy and say thank you.

They take their sandwiches and juice to Lily's room. They see many toys on the floor. They see dolls, cars, blocks, and books. They want to play with everything. They forget about their sandwiches and juice. They leave them on the table.

They play for a long time. They make stories with the dolls and cars. They build towers with the blocks. They look at the pictures in the books. They have fun and laugh.

Then, they hear a noise. They turn around and see Lily's cat. The cat is on the table. The cat is eating their sandwiches and juice. The cat likes tuna. The cat does not like apple juice. The cat spills the juice on the floor.

Lily and Tom are surprised. They say, "Oh no! The cat ate our sandwiches and juice! We forgot to eat them! We were too busy playing!"

Lily's mom hears them. She comes to Lily's room. She sees the cat, the sandwiches, the juice, and the mess. She is not angry. She is kind. She says, "Don't worry, kids. It's okay. The cat was hungry too. I can make you more sandwiches and juice. But first, let's clean up the mess together."

Lily and Tom say, "Okay, mom. We are sorry. We will help you. And we will remember to eat our sandwiches and juice next time."

They clean up the mess with Lily's mom. They wash their hands. They eat their new sandwiches and juice. They are full and happy. They thank Lily's mom. They hug the cat. The cat purrs. They are friends.

Tom and Mia are friends. They like to play outside. But today, it is rain. Rain is wet and cold. They cannot go out.

"Rain, rain, go away. Come again another day," Tom sings. He looks out the window. He sees a big puddle. He wants to jump in it.

"Mia, look! A puddle! Let's go out and splash!" Tom says.

"No, Tom. We cannot go out. Mom said so. We will get sick," Mia says. She has a book. She likes to read.

"Books are boring. Puddles are fun. Come on, Mia. Please," Tom begs.

"No, Tom. I like books. Books are quiet. Puddles are loud. And wet. And cold. No, thank you," Mia says.

Tom is sad. He does not want to read. He wants to play. He thinks of a plan. He gets a towel. He rubs it on his hair. He rubs it on his arms. He rubs it on his legs. He rubs it on his feet. He is dry.

"Look, Mia. I am dry. I can go out. I will not get sick," Tom says.

He opens the door. He runs to the puddle. He jumps in it. He splashes. He laughs.

"Tom, come back! You are wet! You will get sick!" Mia shouts.

She drops her book. She runs to the door. She sees Tom. He is wet. He is cold. He is not laughing. He is sneezing.

"Tom, I told you so. You are sick. You need to come in. You need to get warm. You need to rest," Mia says.

She gets another towel. She wraps it around Tom. She rubs his hair. She rubs his arms. She rubs his legs. She rubs his feet. She is a good friend.

"Sorry, Mia. You were right. Books are better. Puddles are bad. Can you read to me?" Tom says.

"Sure, Tom. I will read to you. But next time, listen to me. And to Mom. Rain is not for playing. Rain is for staying in," Mia says.

They go inside. They sit on the couch. Mia reads to Tom. Tom listens. They are quiet. They are happy. The rain goes on.

Tim and Sam were brothers who liked to fish. They had a big pole that their dad gave them. They went to the lake with their pole and a bucket. They hoped to catch many fish and sell them at the market.

They saw a man with a loud voice and a sign that said "Fish for sale". He had many fish in his cart. He shouted, "Come and buy my fresh fish! They are tasty and cheap!" Tim and Sam wanted to sell their fish like him. They thought he was very smart and rich.

They threw their pole in the water and waited. They waited for a long time, but no fish came. They felt sad and bored. They wondered why the man had so many fish and they had none. They decided to ask him for a tip.

They walked to the man and said, "Hello, sir. We are trying to catch fish and sell them, but we have no luck. Can you tell us your secret?"

The man looked at them and smiled. He said, "Sure, boys. I'll tell you my secret. I don't catch fish. I buy them from the store and sell them here. It's easier and faster. Do you want to buy some?"

Tim and Sam were shocked and angry. They felt cheated and lied to. They said, "No, thank you. We don't want your fish. You are not smart and rich. You are sneaky and bad. We will catch our own fish with our pole. Goodbye!"

They ran back to their pole and bucket. They hoped to catch a big fish and show the man. They learned a lesson that day. They learned that not everyone is honest and that fishing is hard work. But they also learned that fishing is fun and rewarding. They enjoyed their time at the lake with their pole and their bucket.

Lily was sick. She had a bad cough and a sore throat. Mommy gave her some medicine, but Lily did not like it. It was bitter and yucky. She made a face and spit it out.

Mommy was upset. She said, "Lily, you need to take your medicine. It will make you feel better." She tried to give Lily the medicine again, but Lily turned her head and said, "No, no, no!"

Lily ran away from Mommy. She wanted to play with her toys. She did not want to take the medicine. She ran to her room, but she did not see the ball on the floor. She stepped on the ball and stumbled. She fell down and hurt her knee. She cried out loud.

Mommy heard Lily cry. She ran to her room and saw Lily on the floor. She picked her up and hugged her. She said, "Oh, Lily, are you okay? You have a boo-boo on your knee. Let me get a band-aid for you."

Lily stopped crying. She looked at Mommy and said, "I'm sorry, Mommy. I was naughty. I did not take my medicine. Can I have it now?" Mommy smiled and said, "Yes, Lily, you can have your medicine now. I'm glad you changed your mind. It will make you feel better." She gave Lily the medicine and a glass of water. Lily drank it and made a face, but she did not spit it out.

Mommy kissed Lily and said, "Good girl, Lily. I love you. Now, let's go to bed. You need to rest and get well." Lily nodded and said, "I love you too, Mommy. Thank you for the medicine and the band-aid." Mommy tucked Lily in and turned off the light. Lily closed her eyes and fell asleep. She dreamed of happy things.

Tom and Sam are friends. They like to play with cars and balls. One day, they find a big box in the yard. They want to make a boat with the box.

"Let's tie the box to the tree," Tom says. "Then we can pretend we are sailing on the water."

"OK," Sam says. He gets a rope and helps Tom tie the box to the branch. They climb inside the box and sit down.

"Look, there is land over there," Tom says, pointing to the fence. "Maybe there are pirates or animals there."

"Let's go and see," Sam says. He grabs a stick and pretends it is a sword. "But be careful, it might be dangerous."

They jump out of the box and run to the fence. They see a pale girl sitting on the grass. She has a doll and a book. She looks sad and lonely.

"Hi," Tom says. "Who are you?"

"I'm Lily," the girl says. "I just moved here. I don't have any friends."

"Do you want to play with us?" Sam asks. "We have a boat and a sword. We can have fun."

Lily smiles and nods. She puts down her doll and book and follows Tom and Sam. They go back to the box and untie it from the tree. They push it on the ground and pretend it is a boat. They sail to different lands and have adventures. They laugh and talk and become friends.

Sara liked to play in the attic. She found many old things there. Some were toys, some were clothes, some were books. She liked to display them on the floor and pretend they were hers.

One day, she found a big box in the corner. She opened it and saw a doll. The doll had long hair, a pretty dress and shiny shoes. Sara was happy. She took the doll out and hugged it. She wanted to display it with her other things.

But the doll was not nice. It had a mean face and sharp teeth. It bit Sara's arm and made her cry. Sara was scared and hurt. She threw the doll back in the box and ran away. She did not want to play in the attic anymore.

She went to her mom and showed her the bite. Her mom was worried and angry. She asked Sara where she got the bite. Sara told her about the doll in the attic. Her mom did not believe her. She thought Sara was lying.

She took Sara to the attic and opened the box. She wanted to see the doll. But the box was empty. There was no doll. Sara was confused and uncomfortable. She did not know where the doll went. She hoped it would not come back.

Anna liked to sign songs with her hands. She learned sign from her friend Mia, who could not hear. Anna and Mia played together at school and taught each other new signs.

One day, Anna wanted to sign a song for her mom. She looked for her book of songs on the shelf in her room. But she could not find it. She saw that her brother Ben had taken it. He was reading it on his bed.

"Ben, give me my book!" Anna said. "I need it to sign a song for mom."

"No, I want to read it," Ben said. "It has nice pictures and words."

"Please, Ben, it is my book. You are naughty to take it," Anna said. She tried to grab the book from Ben, but he held it tight.

They pulled and pushed the book until it ripped. They both gasped and looked at the torn pages. They felt sad and sorry.

"Mom will be mad at us," Ben said.

"I know. We were both naughty," Anna said. "Let's say sorry to mom and to each other. And let's fix the book with tape."

They hugged and said sorry. Then they went to find mom and told her what happened. Mom was not happy, but she was glad they were honest and kind. She helped them tape the book and hugged them.

"Can you still sign a song for me, Anna?" mom asked.

"Yes, mom. I remember some signs. And Ben can help me," Anna said.

They signed a song together for mom. It was a song about saying sorry and being friends. Mom smiled and clapped. She was proud of them.

Lila and Ben are playing in the garden. They have a big bucket of water and some cups. They pour water on the flowers, on the grass, and on each other. They laugh and splash and have fun.

"Look, Lila, I can make a big wave!" Ben says. He fills his cup with water and throws it in the air. The water falls down on Lila's head and makes her wet.

"Hey, Ben, that's not nice!" Lila says. She feels the water on her face and hair. She wipes her face with her hand and shakes her head. "Now I'm all wet and cold!"

"I'm sorry, Lila, I was just playing," Ben says. He sees that Lila is not happy. He wants to make her smile again. He thinks of something. "Do you want to see something funny?"

"What is it?" Lila asks. She is curious.

Ben runs to the clothesline, where his mom hung some clothes to dry. He finds a long scarf that belongs to his dad. He wraps it around his neck and face, leaving only his eyes and nose out. He looks like a mummy. He runs back to Lila and says, "Boo!"

Lila sees Ben and his silly scarf. She forgets that she is wet and cold. She starts to giggle. She thinks Ben looks very funny. She says, "Ben, you look like a mummy! A mummy with a long scarf!"

Ben laughs too. He unwraps the scarf and says, "It's not a mummy, it's me! Do you want to try it?"

Lila nods. She takes the scarf from Ben and wraps it around her neck and face. She says, "Boo!"

They both laugh and play with the scarf. They forget about the water and the cold. They are happy and warm.

Sara and Ben are twins. They like to play and sing. One day, they find a big hat and a long scarf in Mom's closet. They put them on and pretend to be opera singers.

"Hello, I am Sara, the best opera singer in the world!" Sara says in a loud voice.

"And I am Ben, the most handsome opera singer in the world!" Ben says in a loud voice.

They start to sing a song they make up. They sing very high and very low. They sing very fast and very slow. They sing very loud and very soft. They make funny faces and gestures.

Mom hears them and comes to see what they are doing. She sees them in the hat and the scarf, singing their silly song. She smiles and claps her hands.

"Bravo, bravo, you are wonderful opera singers!" Mom says in a kind voice.

Sara and Ben stop singing and bow. They are happy that Mom likes their show. They run to hug her and say thank you.

Mom is compassionate. She loves Sara and Ben very much. She laughs with them and tells them they are very creative and funny. She says they can keep the hat and the scarf and play opera anytime they want. Sara and Ben are very happy. They love Mom very much. They laugh with her and tell her they love her too.

Lila and Ben were friends who liked to play in the park. They had a plan to make a path with stones and sticks. They wanted to make the path go from the slide to the swings. They thought it would be fun to walk on the path and pretend they were on an adventure.

They started to look for stones and sticks on the ground. They found some big ones and some small ones. They put them in a pile near the slide. Then they began to lay them on the grass, making a line. They were happy with their plan.

But then they saw a big dog running towards them. The dog was barking and wagging its tail. It looked friendly, but Lila and Ben were scared. They did not know the dog. They did not know if it was nice or mean. They ran away from the slide and the path. They hid behind a bench.

"Go away, dog!" Lila shouted. "This is our path! You can't ruin it!"

The dog did not listen. It jumped on the slide and slid down. It landed on the path and knocked over some stones and sticks. It ran around the path, making a mess. It thought it was a game.

Lila and Ben were troubled. They did not like the dog. They did not like what it did to their path. They wanted it to leave. They looked for someone who could help them. They saw a lady walking with a leash. She was the dog's owner.

"Miss, miss!" Ben called. "Please get your dog! It is ruining our path!"

The lady heard Ben and saw the dog. She was sorry. She ran to the dog and put the leash on it. She apologized to Lila and Ben.

"I'm so sorry, kids. I didn't see you there. My dog is very playful, but he doesn't mean any harm. He just likes to have fun. I hope he didn't hurt your path too much."

Lila and Ben looked at their path. It was not as nice as before. Some stones and sticks were out of place. Some were broken. They were sad.

"It's okay, miss," Lila said. "We can fix it. We can make it better. We still have our plan."

The lady smiled and thanked them. She walked away with the dog. Lila and Ben went back to the slide and the path. They picked up the stones and sticks. They rearranged them on the grass. They made the path go from the slide to the swings. They were happy with their plan. They walked on the path and pretended they were on an adventure.

Tom and Lily were playing in the park. They saw a big hole in the ground. They wanted to know what was inside.

"Let's go and look," said Tom.

"No, it might be dangerous," said Lily.

But Tom did not listen. He jumped into the hole. Lily was scared. She called for Tom, but he did not answer.

Tom went deeper and deeper into the hole. It was dark and cold. He heard a loud growl. He saw a big bear. The bear was grumpy. He did not like visitors in his home.

"Who are you? What are you doing here?" the bear roared.

Tom was very afraid. He wished he had listened to Lily. He said, "I'm sorry, Mr. Bear. I was curious. I wanted to know what was underground. Please don't hurt me."

The bear looked at Tom. He saw that he was a small boy. He felt sorry for him. He said, "You are lucky, boy. I'm not hungry today. But you should not come here again. This is my home. You belong above the ground. Go back to your friend. And remember, curiosity can be dangerous."

The bear helped Tom out of the hole. Tom ran to Lily. He hugged her and said, "I'm sorry, Lily. You were right. I should have listened to you. I met a grumpy bear underground. He was scary, but he let me go. I learned my lesson. I will not be so curious again."

Lily was happy that Tom was safe. She said, "I'm glad you're okay, Tom. I forgive you. But next time, please be careful. There are many things to know and explore, but some things are better left alone."

Tom and Lily went home. They told their parents what happened. Their parents were proud of them. They said, "You are brave and smart, Tom and Lily. You learned a valuable lesson today. Curiosity is good, but it must be balanced with caution and respect. Knowing when to stop is also important. We love you very much."

Lily and Ben love to play with their toy instruments. Lily has a small drum and Ben has a tiny guitar. They pretend to be musicians and make loud noises. Sometimes they sing along, too.

One day, they decide to play in the garden. They find a huge tree with many leaves. They think it is a good place to make music. They sit under the tree and start to play. They are very happy.

But then, they hear a loud roar. They look up and see a big lion on the tree. The lion is angry and hungry. He wants to eat them. Lily and Ben are very scared. They drop their instruments and run away.

"Help! Help!" they shout.

Their mom hears them and comes out. She sees the lion and grabs a big blanket. She throws the blanket over the lion and covers him. The lion is confused and can't see. He stops roaring and tries to get out.

"Go away, lion!" mom says. "You can't eat my children!"

She takes Lily and Ben by the hand and runs inside the house. She locks the door and hugs them.

"Are you okay, my loves?" she asks.

"Yes, mom, we are okay," Lily and Ben say. "Thank you for saving us!"

They are very grateful and proud of their mom. They tell her about their music and their instruments. Mom smiles and says they are very brave and creative.

"Maybe we can play music together later," she says. "But first, let's have some cookies and milk."

Lily and Ben agree. They love their mom and their music. They forget about the lion and the huge tree. They are very happy.

Tom and Anna were twins who liked to play in the living room. They saw a big tree with shiny things on it. Mommy said the shiny things were ornaments and they were very pretty. She also said they were very fragile and they should not touch them.

But Tom and Anna were curious and wanted to see the ornaments up close. They waited until Mommy was busy in the kitchen and then they tiptoed to the tree. They reached for the ornaments and tried to take them off the branches. But the ornaments were slippery and some of them fell to the floor. They made a loud noise and broke into pieces.

Mommy heard the noise and came to the living room. She saw the broken ornaments and the mess on the floor. She was very angry and sad. She said to Tom and Anna, "What have you done? You have destroyed the ornaments! They were very special to me. They were from Grandma and Grandpa. They are gone now and I can't fix them. You are very naughty and you have to go to your room. No more playing for you today."

Tom and Anna felt very sorry and scared. They did not mean to destroy the ornaments. They just wanted to look at them. They said to Mommy, "We are sorry, Mommy. We did not know they were from Grandma and Grandpa. We did not know they would break. Please don't be mad at us. We love you, Mommy."

Mommy sighed and hugged them. She said, "I love you too, Tom and Anna. But you have to be more careful and listen to me. The ornaments were very important to me and I can't get them back. You have to learn to respect other people's things. Now go to your room and think about what you did. Maybe later we can talk more and make some new ornaments together."

Tom and Anna nodded and went to their room. They felt very bad and wished they had not touched the ornaments. They hoped Mommy would forgive them and they could make her happy again. They sat on their beds and were very quiet.

Lily and Tom are twins. They like to play and have fun. They are very happy because they are going on holiday with Mum and Dad. They pack their bags and toys and get in the car.

The car goes very fast on the road. Lily and Tom look out the window and see many things. They see cows and sheep and trees and houses. They tell each other what they see and make up stories. They sing songs and laugh.

After a long time, the car stops at a big house. Mum and Dad say this is where they will stay for the holiday. They get out of the car and take their bags and toys. They go inside the house and look around. It is very nice and cosy.

But there is a problem. The house has a smelly smell. It smells like old socks and cheese and fish. Lily and Tom do not like the smell. They cover their noses and say yuck. Mum and Dad do not like the smell either. They say sorry and look for the source of the smell.

They find it in the kitchen. It is a big bin full of rubbish. Someone forgot to take it out before they left. Mum and Dad take the bin outside and throw it away. They open the windows and spray some perfume. The smell goes away and the house is fresh and clean.

Lily and Tom are happy again. They say thank you and give Mum and Dad a hug. They unpack their bags and toys and choose their rooms. They are ready to enjoy their holiday. They hope to see more cows and sheep and trees and houses. They hope to have more fun and make more stories. They hope the house does not get smelly again.

Ben and Lily are brother and sister. They like to play together. Sometimes they play with toys, sometimes they play with books, sometimes they play with puzzles.

One day, they want to play with TV. TV is big and shiny. It has many colors and sounds. Ben and Lily like to watch TV.

But Mom says, "No, TV is not for playing. TV is for watching. You can watch TV for a little time, but then you have to play with something else."

Ben and Lily are sad. They want to play with TV more. They ask Mom, "Why can't we play with TV? TV is fun. TV is nice."

Mom says, "TV is fun and nice, but TV is not good for you if you watch too much. TV can make your eyes tired and your brain sleepy. You need to play with other things that make your eyes happy and your brain smart. Like toys, books, puzzles, or outside."

Ben and Lily think about it. They like to make their eyes happy and their brain smart. They say, "OK, Mom. We will watch TV for a little time, and then we will play with other things."

Mom smiles and says, "Good. I love you, Ben and Lily. You are good children."

Ben and Lily watch TV for a little time. They see animals and songs and stories. They laugh and clap and sing. Then they turn off TV and go to play with other things. They have fun. They are happy.

Lila and her mom were in the car. They wanted to go to the zoo. Lila loved the zoo. She wanted to see the wild animals. She hoped to see the lions and the monkeys and the giraffes.

But the car was not moving. There were many cars in front of them and behind them. They were stuck in traffic. Lila was sad. She looked out the window and saw the red lights and the honking horns.

"Mom, why are we not moving?" she asked.

"Because there is too much traffic, honey. Sometimes there are too many cars on the road and they make a big jam. We have to wait until the jam clears," mom said.

"How long do we have to wait?" Lila asked.

"I don't know, honey. Maybe a few minutes, maybe a long time. It depends on how fast the cars can move," mom said.

Lila sighed. She did not like waiting. She wanted to go to the zoo. She hoped the traffic would go away soon. She hoped the zoo would not close before they got there. She hoped the wild animals would not be too tired or too hungry to play with her. She hoped they would have fun at the zoo. She hoped, she hoped, she hoped.

Sara and Tom love to play with their kayak. It is brown and big and floats on the water. They like to paddle and splash and see the fish and the birds. One day, they find a small island with a lot of flowers and trees. They decide to explore it and have a picnic.

"Look, Sara, what a pretty necklace!" Tom says, picking up a string of shells and beads. He puts it around Sara's neck and smiles. "You are very pretty, Sara. Do you want to marry me?"

Sara giggles and nods. "Yes, Tom, I want to marry you. You are very nice and funny. But how can we marry?"

Tom thinks for a moment. He remembers that his mom and dad had a ring and a cake and a party when they married. He looks around and sees a big leaf and a berry. He takes the leaf and makes a hole in it. He puts the berry in the hole and makes a ring. He gives it to Sara and says, "Here, Sara, this is your ring. Now we are married."

Sara puts the ring on her finger and hugs Tom. "Thank you, Tom, this is a beautiful ring. Now we are married."

They share their sandwich and juice and have a cake of cookies. They dance and sing and laugh. They are very happy. They get back in their kayak and paddle home. They tell their mom and dad that they are married. Their mom and dad smile and hug them. They are proud of their children. They say, "You are very sweet, Sara and Tom. But you are still very young. You can play and pretend, but you are not really married. You have to grow up and learn a lot of things before you can marry. But we love you very much and we are happy that you are friends."

Sara and Tom understand. They are not sad. They know that they are still children and have a lot of fun to have. They keep their necklace and ring and kayak. They play and pretend and dream. They are still friends. And maybe, one day, when they are big, they will marry for real.

Sam had a watch that he liked very much. It was blue and shiny and it made a tick-tock sound. He wore it every day and showed it to his friends. He felt mighty with his watch.

One day, a man came to his house. He had a big bag full of toys and books. He said he wanted to sell them to Sam and his mom. He saw Sam's watch and said, "What a nice watch you have! Do you want to trade it for something in my bag?"

Sam looked at the bag and saw many things that he wanted. He saw a red car, a yellow ball, a green dinosaur, a brown bear, and a big book with pictures. He thought they were all very fun and cool. He said, "Yes, I want to trade my watch for something in your bag. What can I have?"

The man smiled and said, "You can have anything you want, but only one thing. Choose wisely, because you can't change your mind later." He opened the bag and let Sam see all the things inside.

Sam thought hard. He liked his watch, but he also liked the toys and books. He wanted to have them all, but he knew he had to pick one. He looked at the red car, the yellow ball, the green dinosaur, the brown bear, and the big book. He wondered which one he would play with the most. He wondered which one would make him feel mighty.

He decided to trade his watch for the big book. He liked books because they had stories and pictures that he could look at and read. He thought the book would make him learn new things and have new adventures. He said, "I want the big book, please."

The man nodded and said, "Okay, here you go. Give me your watch and take the book. It's a fair trade." He took Sam's watch and gave him the book. He said, "Thank you, Sam. Enjoy your book. Goodbye." He left with his bag and Sam's watch.

Sam opened the book and saw many pages with words and drawings. He felt happy and excited. He said, "Mom, look at my book! It's so big and nice! Can you read it to me?"

His mom smiled and said, "Sure, Sam. I'm glad you like your book. It looks very interesting. Let's sit down and read it together." She hugged him and said, "You are a mighty boy, Sam. You made a good choice."

Anna and Ben are friends. They like to play together. Today, they have a task. They have to find a beautiful flower for their teacher.

They walk in the park. They see many flowers. Some are red, some are yellow, some are pink. But they want to find the most beautiful flower of all.

They see a big hill. They think maybe there is a beautiful flower on top of the hill. They run to the hill. They jump over rocks and sticks. They climb up the hill. They are tired, but they are happy.

They reach the top of the hill. They look around. They see a big, bright, purple flower. It is the most beautiful flower they have ever seen. They smile at each other. They pick the flower. They run down the hill. They jump over rocks and sticks. They are tired, but they are happy.

They go back to their teacher. They give her the flower. She is very happy. She says they did a good job. She says they are very kind. She says the flower is beautiful. Anna and Ben are proud. They hug their teacher. They hug each other. They are friends.

Lily liked to play the flute. She had a small flute that made pretty sounds when she blew into it. She learned how to play from her big sister, who was very good at music.

One day, Lily went to the park with her mom and her flute. She saw some other kids playing on the swings and slides. She wanted to join them, but she was shy. She held her flute close to her chest and looked at them.

"Hi, what's that?" a boy asked her, pointing at her flute. He had curly hair and a friendly smile.

"It's a flute," Lily said softly.

"Can you play it?" the boy asked.

"A little," Lily said.

"Can I hear it?" the boy asked.

Lily nodded. She put the flute to her lips and played a simple tune. The boy clapped his hands and smiled.

"That was nice," he said. "What's your name?"

"Lily," she said.

"I'm Ben," he said. "Do you want to play with us?"

Lily looked at her mom, who nodded and smiled. She felt happy and brave.

"Okay," she said.

She followed Ben to the swings and slides. They played together and had fun. Lily made a new friend. She was glad she mentioned her flute.

Sara and Tom are playing in the kitchen. They want to make a cake for Mom. They have a big bowl, some flour, some eggs, some milk and some sugar. They also have a spoon to stir.

"Tom, can you stir the flour and the eggs?" Sara asks.

"OK, Sara, I can stir," Tom says. He takes the spoon and stirs the flour and the eggs. He stirs and stirs until they are mixed.

"Good job, Tom! Now we need to add the milk and the sugar," Sara says. She pours the milk and the sugar into the bowl. "Can you stir some more, Tom?"

"OK, Sara, I can stir some more," Tom says. He stirs and stirs until the milk and the sugar are mixed with the flour and the eggs. He stirs and stirs until the batter is smooth.

"Wow, Tom, you are a good stirrer!" Sara says. "Now we need to put the batter in the pan and bake the cake."

"OK, Sara, let's do that," Tom says. They pour the batter in the pan and put the pan in the oven. They set the timer and wait for the cake to be done.

While they wait, they see a letter on the table. It is from Grandma. Sara picks up the letter and opens it. She reads it out loud to Tom.

"Dear Sara and Tom, I miss you very much. I hope you are having fun and being good. I sent you a nice surprise in the mail. It should arrive soon. I love you. Grandma."

"Wow, Sara, Grandma is so nice!" Tom says. "I wonder what the surprise is."

"Me too, Tom. Maybe it is a toy or a book or a candy," Sara says. "I love Grandma."

"I love Grandma too," Tom says. They hug each other and smile.

Then they hear the timer beep. The cake is done. They take it out of the oven and let it cool. They decorate it with frosting and sprinkles. They write "We love you, Mom" on the cake with a squeeze bottle.

They are very proud of their cake. They can't wait to show it to Mom and share it with her. They know Mom will love it. They know Mom is nice. They love Mom.

Once upon a time, there was a parrot named Polly. Polly was very colorful and had a big beak. Polly lived in a deep forest with many other animals. One day, Polly decided to travel to a new place. 

Polly flew for a long time until she reached a big city. She saw many people and buildings, but she didn't know where to go. Suddenly, a man came and took Polly away. He put Polly in a small cage and took her to his house. 

Polly was very sad because she missed her friends in the deep forest. She tried to escape from the cage, but she couldn't. She realized that it was not a good idea to travel alone without knowing where to go. 

The moral of the story is that it's important to be careful when we travel and to always have a plan. We should also be kind to animals and not take them away from their homes.

Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily who loved to play dress-up. She would fashion her own outfits from her mom's old clothes and pretend she was a princess. One day, Lily's mom bought her a special present - a dollhouse! Lily was so happy and couldn't wait to play with it. 

But the dollhouse was in a big box and Lily's mom said they had to wrap it first before she could open it. So they got some paper and tape and wrapped the box up nice and tight. Lily was so excited to see her new toy that she couldn't wait for her mom to finish wrapping. 

Finally, the box was all wrapped up and Lily tore off the paper to reveal her new dollhouse. It was so pretty and regular sized, just perfect for her dolls to live in. Lily spent the whole day playing with her new toy, imagining all sorts of adventures for her dolls to go on.

Once upon a time, there was a little bunny named Benny. Benny was very poor and had no food to eat. One day, Benny decided to go on a journey to find some food. He hopped through the forest and over the hills.

After a while, Benny met a kind deer. The deer asked Benny where he was going. Benny told the deer that he was on a journey to find some food because he was very hungry. The deer whispered to Benny that he knew where there was a big carrot patch. Benny was so happy and thanked the deer.

Benny finally found the carrot patch, but just as he was about to take a bite, a big, mean fox appeared. The fox wanted to eat Benny for dinner! Benny tried to run away, but he was too slow. The fox caught him and had him for dinner. Poor Benny!

Once upon a time, there was a friendly bear named Benny. He loved to eat waffles for breakfast every day. One morning, when Benny woke up, he demanded his waffles right away. But his mom told him to wait a little bit because she was making them fresh.

Benny didn't want to wait, so he went outside to play with his friends. They played tag and hide-and-seek until Benny's mom called him in for breakfast. When Benny saw the waffles, he was so happy! He ate them all up and felt very full.

After breakfast, Benny and his friends went to the park to play some more. They had so much fun together and were very friendly to each other. Benny was grateful for his friends and his yummy waffles.

Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play with his toys and run around outside. One day, Timmy fell down and hurt his knee. He cried and cried because it hurt so much. 

His mommy came over and picked him up. She hugged him and said, "Don't worry, Timmy. It's okay. I'm here to comfort you." She gave him a snack, a yummy apple, to make him feel better. 

After a little while, Timmy's knee started to feel normal again. He smiled and went back to playing with his toys. He was happy because his mommy was there to make him feel better.

Once upon a time, there was a big truck. The truck was very loud and had many wheels. It was a vehicle that helped move things from one place to another. 

One day, a little bird was flying above the truck. The bird was very graceful and flew with ease. The bird wanted to measure how big the truck was, so it flew down and landed on the hood. 

The bird looked at the truck and saw that it was very long and tall. It was too big for the little bird to measure, but it was still very impressive. The bird flew away, feeling happy to have seen such a big and powerful vehicle.

Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved to play outside and watch the birds fly in the sky. One day, Timmy's mom told him they were going to a fair. Timmy was so excited!

At the fair, Timmy saw a big ride with swings that went up high in the air. Timmy wanted to go on it so badly, but he was too short. Timmy's mom said they could come back when he was taller.

Later, Timmy saw a group of older kids playing a game. They asked Timmy if he wanted to play too. Timmy was happy to join, but he didn't know the rules. When he made a mistake, the older kids laughed and teased him. Timmy felt embarrassed.

As they were leaving the fair, Timmy saw a butterfly. It reminded him of the birds he loved to watch. He knew he would grow taller one day and be able to ride the swings. And he also knew that it's okay to make mistakes and feel embarrassed sometimes.

Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved taking pictures with her camera. One day, she took a picture of a sweet flower in the garden. She was so happy with the picture that she wanted to mail it to her grandma. 

Lily went to the mailbox and put the picture inside. She was excited for her grandma to receive it. The next day, Lily's grandma called her on the phone. She said she got the mail and loved the sweet picture. 

Lily was so happy that her grandma liked the picture. She knew she wanted to take more pictures and mail them to her grandma. From that day on, Lily took pictures of everything she saw and mailed them to her grandma. They both loved looking at the sweet pictures together.

Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy. Timmy was very tall for his age. He loved looking up at the sky and imagining all the things in the world. One day, Timmy went to the park to play. He saw a girl named Sally and asked if she wanted to play with him.

Sally said, "Sure! What do you want to play?"

Timmy said, "Let's add some blocks to my tower and make it taller than the world!"

Sally smiled and said, "That sounds like fun! Let's do it!"

So, Timmy and Sally added blocks to the tower and it grew taller and taller. When they were done, Timmy looked up at the tower and said, "Wow! It's taller than the world!"

Sally laughed and said, "No silly, it's not taller than the world. But it's still really tall!"

Timmy smiled and said, "Thanks for helping me make it taller, Sally. You're a great friend!"

Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. One day, her mommy asked her to come to the grocery store with her. Lily was very happy and excited to go. When they got there, they saw a big mess on the floor. Lily's mommy said, "Oh no, this is messy. We need to be careful not to slip and fall."

Lily said, "I can help clean it up!" But her mommy said, "No, it's not safe for you. I'll take care of it." As they were walking down the aisle, Lily saw a toy she really wanted. She asked her mommy if they could buy it, but her mommy said they didn't have enough money for it.

Lily was sad and started crying. Her mommy hugged her and said, "Don't worry, we can save up for it next time." Lily felt better and they continued shopping. When they got home, Lily helped her mommy put away the groceries. She felt happy that she could help and that they had a nice time together.

Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. He had a black cat named Mittens. Timmy loved to play with Mittens and bounce his ball around the backyard. One day, Timmy found a shiny penny on the ground and he was very happy.

But then, Mittens saw the penny and wanted to play with it too. Mittens tried to grab the penny with her paws, but it kept rolling away. Timmy didn't want Mittens to take his penny, so he tried to grab it too. They both fought over the penny until it bounced away and rolled under the fence.

Timmy and Mittens were sad that they lost the penny, but they quickly forgot about it and started playing with the ball again. They realized that playing together was much more fun than fighting over a penny.

Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a big smile and rosy cheeks, but she felt lonely because she had no friends to play with. One day, she went to the park and saw a little boy sitting on a bench, looking sad.

Lily went to the boy and asked, "Why are you sad?" The boy replied, "I lost my toy car and I can't find it." Lily said, "I understand how you feel. I lost my favorite doll once."

The boy looked at Lily's lip and said, "You have a pretty lip." Lily smiled and said, "Thank you. Do you want to play with me? We can look for your toy car together." The boy's face lit up and he said, "Yes, please!"

Lily and the boy had so much fun playing together and they found the toy car too. From that day on, they became best friends and never felt lonely again.

Once upon a time, there was a small girl named Lily. She loved to look at herself in the mirror. One day, she was looking at herself in the mirror when her mom came in. 

"Hi, Lily! What are you doing?" her mom asked.

"I'm looking at myself in the mirror. I like my small nose and my pretty dress," Lily said.

"That's nice, Lily. But remember to always mind what you say to yourself in the mirror. You are beautiful just the way you are," her mom said.

Sara liked to play with her dolls in the park. She had many dolls and she gave them names and clothes. She was happy when she played with her dolls.

One day, a boy came to the park. He had a big truck and he made loud noises. He said, "Vroom, vroom, crash, bang!" He drove his truck near Sara and her dolls. He did not see them and he hit them with his truck. Sara's dolls fell down and some of their clothes came off.

Sara was sad and angry. She said, "Hey, you are bad! You hurt my dolls! Go away!" The boy stopped his truck and looked at Sara. He said, "Sorry, I did not see your dolls. I like to play with my truck. It is fun and loud."

Sara said, "But your truck is not fun for me. It is loud and scary. It makes me and my dolls unhappy. You should play somewhere else." The boy said, "But I like this park. It has grass and trees and flowers. And I want to play with you. You have many dolls. They are pretty and soft. Can I play with you and your dolls?"

Sara thought for a moment. She did not like the boy's truck, but she liked the park too. And she liked to play with other children. She said, "OK, you can play with me and my dolls. But you have to be careful and gentle. And you have to be quiet. No more loud noises. Do you understand?" The boy nodded and smiled. He said, "OK, I understand. I will be careful and gentle and quiet. Thank you for letting me play with you and your dolls."

Sara and the boy played together in the park. They shared their toys and they talked and laughed. They became friends and they had fun. They learned to respect each other's feelings and preferences. They learned that playing together is better than playing alone.

Sara and Tom like to play in the park. They like to climb the trees and swing on the branches. One day, they find a big branch on the ground. It is brown and hard and has many leaves.

"Look, Tom, this is a magic branch!" Sara says. "We can wear it like a crown and be the king and queen of the park!"

Tom likes the idea. He helps Sara put the branch on her head. It is heavy and prickly, but Sara does not mind. She feels like a queen. She gives Tom a leaf to wear on his head. He feels like a king.

They walk around the park, holding hands and smiling. They see a man sitting on a bench. He is old and has white hair and a long beard. He looks at Sara and Tom and smiles.

"Hello, little ones," he says. "What are you wearing on your heads?"

Sara and Tom tell him about the magic branch. They say it makes them the king and queen of the park.

The man nods and laughs. He says, "You have a good imagination. Do you know where this branch came from?"

Sara and Tom shake their heads. They do not know.

The man says, "This branch is very old. It is ancient. It came from a tree that was here before the park was made. It was a big and beautiful tree. It gave shade and fruits and flowers to many people and animals. But one day, a storm came and broke the tree. The branch fell to the ground and stayed there for a long time. It is a part of the history of this place."

Sara and Tom listen to the man. They feel amazed and curious. They ask him more questions about the tree and the park and the storm. The man tells them many stories. He is happy to share his knowledge and memories.

Sara and Tom are happy to learn and listen. They thank the man for his stories. They say goodbye and go back to their game. They still wear the branch and the leaf on their heads. They feel proud and special. They have a magic branch that connects them to the past and the present. They have a new friend who teaches them about the world. They have each other to play and have fun. They are the king and queen of the park.

Tom is a boy who likes to write. He has a new book with many pages. He writes his name on the first page. He writes what he sees on the second page. He sees a big mill near his house. The mill has a wheel that turns and turns.

One day, Tom goes to the mill with his dad. His dad works at the mill. He makes flour from wheat. Tom wants to write about the mill. He takes his book and a pen. He looks at the mill and writes what he sees. He writes "mill", "wheel", "flour", "wheat".

Tom is happy. He shows his book to his dad. His dad is proud. He says "You are a good writer, Tom. You write what you see. You write simple words. You write a nice story." Tom smiles. He likes to write. He likes his new book. He likes the mill.

Ben likes to play with his toy cars. He has many cars of different colors and sizes. He likes to make them zoom and beep on the floor. Sometimes he pretends he is a driver and takes his cars to different places.

One day, Ben sees that his cars are very dirty. They have dust and mud on them. He thinks they need a wash. He asks his mom if he can wash his cars. His mom says yes, but he has to do it outside. She gives him a bucket of water and a sponge.

Ben takes his cars and the bucket outside. He finds a clear spot on the grass. He dips the sponge in the water and starts to wash his cars. He rubs them gently and makes them shiny and clean. He is happy to see his cars sparkle in the sun.

He hears a voice behind him. It is his friend Lily. She lives next door. She sees Ben washing his cars and says hello.

"Hi, Ben. What are you doing?" she asks.

"I am washing my cars. They were very dirty. Now they are very clean," Ben says.

"Can I help you?" Lily asks.

"Sure. You can wash this one. It is blue. It is my favorite," Ben says. He gives Lily a blue car and a sponge.

Lily smiles and takes the car and the sponge. She dips the sponge in the water and starts to wash the car. She likes the blue car too. She thinks it is pretty.

Ben and Lily wash the cars together. They talk and laugh and have fun. They are good friends. They like to play with cars.

Lily and Ben were playing in the park with their mom. They liked to slide, swing, and run around. They also liked to drink juice from the cooler that mom brought. The cooler was big and blue and had ice inside.

One day, a big dog came to the park. He was brown and furry and had a long tail. He saw the cooler and ran towards it. He wanted to drink the juice too. He knocked over the cooler and spilled the juice on the grass. Lily and Ben were scared and ran to their mom.

"Mom, mom, the dog is bad! He took our juice!" Lily cried.

"Shoo, shoo, go away!" mom said to the dog. She tried to pick up the cooler and the juice, but the dog barked and growled. He did not want to leave.

Mom felt helpless. She did not know what to do. She looked around and saw a man with a leash. He was the dog's owner. She called to him.

"Sir, sir, can you please get your dog? He is making a mess and scaring my children!" mom said.

The man heard mom's question and came over. He saw the dog and the cooler and the juice. He was sorry and embarrassed.

"I'm so sorry, ma'am. He escaped from his leash. He is usually friendly, but he loves juice. Let me help you clean up," the man said.

He put the leash on the dog and pulled him away. He also helped mom put the ice and the juice back in the cooler. He apologized again and left.

Mom hugged Lily and Ben and gave them a new juice. They were happy and thanked the man. They learned that some dogs can be naughty, but some people can be nice. They finished their juice and went back to play.

Here is one possible story, but there are many other ways to write it.

Ben and Lily went to the park with their mom. They saw a big maze made of tall plants. They wanted to play in the maze. Mom said, "Be careful, don't get lost. I will wait for you here."

Ben and Lily ran into the maze. They had fun finding new paths and hiding from each other. But soon they realized they did not know how to get out. They started to feel scared and sad. They called for mom, but she did not hear them.

They saw a sign that said, "Exit this way." They followed the sign, hoping to see mom. But the sign was a trick. It led them to a dead end. There was a camera and a speaker. A voice said, "Ha ha, you fell for it. This is a modern maze. It is a prank. You are on TV. Everyone can see how silly you are."

Ben and Lily felt very embarrassed. They wanted to cry. They wished they never went into the maze. They wished they stayed with mom. They did not like the modern maze. They did not like the prank. They did not like the voice. They did not like the TV. They did not like anything.

Anna and Ben are twins. They like to play with their toys and their dog, Spot. Spot is a big, furry dog who likes to lick their faces and run with them in the yard.

One day, Anna and Ben are playing with their purple ball. They throw it to each other and to Spot. Spot runs fast and catches the ball in his mouth. He brings it back to them and wags his tail. Anna and Ben laugh and clap their hands.

But soon, they start to feel tired. They yawn and rub their eyes. Mommy comes and says, "It's time for a nap, my sweeties. Come on, let's go to your room." Anna and Ben nod and follow Mommy. They hug Spot and say, "Bye, Spot. See you later."

Mommy takes them to their room, where they have two beds with soft blankets and pillows. She tucks them in and kisses their cheeks. She says, "Sleep well, my loves. I'll be here when you wake up." She turns on a small lamp that makes a warm glow. She leaves the door ajar.

Anna and Ben close their eyes and snuggle with their teddy bears. They feel cozy and safe. They hear Spot's snores from the living room. They smile and drift into a nap. They dream of purple ball and Spot and Mommy. They are happy.

Sara and Ben were playing in the backyard. They saw a big pile of leaves that their dad had raked. They wanted to jump in the leaves and have fun.

"Can we jump in the leaves, dad?" Sara asked.

"Sure, but be careful. Don't go near the fire pit. It is very hot and dangerous," dad said.

Sara and Ben nodded and ran to the leaves. They jumped and laughed and threw leaves in the air. They felt happy and warm.

But then Ben saw something shiny in the fire pit. It looked like a spark. He was curious and wanted to see it better. He walked closer to the fire pit.

"Ben, no! Come back!" Sara shouted. She saw the fire pit and remembered what dad said. She was scared for Ben.

Ben did not listen. He reached out his hand to touch the spark. But the spark was not alone. There was a thick smoke and a loud crackle. Ben felt a pain in his hand and a heat in his face. He screamed and pulled back his hand.

Dad heard the scream and ran to the fire pit. He saw Ben crying and holding his hand. He saw the smoke and the spark. He was angry and worried.

"Ben, what did you do? I told you not to go near the fire pit. You could have been hurt very badly. Let me see your hand," dad said.

He took Ben's hand and looked at it. It was red and swollen. He wrapped it in a cloth and hugged Ben.

"I'm sorry, dad. I wanted to see the spark. It seemed pretty. I didn't know it was hot and bad," Ben said.

"I know, Ben. But you have to listen to me. The fire pit is not a toy. It is for grown-ups only. The spark can burn you and make you sick. You have to be careful and stay away from it. Do you understand?" dad said.

"Yes, dad. I understand. I'm sorry. I won't do it again," Ben said.

Dad kissed Ben's head and carried him inside. He gave him some ice and some medicine. He told him to rest and be brave.

Sara followed them inside. She felt sorry for Ben. She also felt a little scared of the fire pit. She decided to play with her dolls instead. She hoped Ben would feel better soon.

Tom and Anna were playing with scissors and paper. They wanted to make snowflakes and stars. Tom was very good at cutting shapes. He showed Anna how to fold the paper and cut along the edges. Anna tried to copy him, but she was not very careful. She cut her thumb with the scissors. It hurt a lot and it bled.

"Ow, ow, ow!" Anna cried. "I cut my thumb! It hurts!"

Tom heard her cry and ran to her. He saw her thumb and the blood. He felt sorry for her, but he also felt disgusted. He did not like blood. It made him feel sick.

"Anna, don't cry. Let me see your thumb," Tom said. He took her hand and looked at the cut. It was not very big, but it was deep. He knew he had to help her. He remembered what his mom told him to do when he got a cut.

"Anna, we have to wash your thumb and put a band-aid on it. Come with me to the bathroom," Tom said. He led her to the sink and turned on the water. He washed her thumb gently and dried it with a towel. He found a band-aid in the cabinet and put it on her thumb.

"There, all done. Does it feel better?" Tom asked.

Anna nodded. She felt less pain and more calm. She smiled at Tom and thanked him.

"Thank you, Tom. You are very kind. You are a good friend," Anna said.

Tom smiled back. He was glad he could help her. He was a good friend.

"Anna, you are welcome. You are a good friend too. Do you want to play something else?" Tom asked.

Anna nodded. She did not want to play with scissors and paper anymore. She wanted to play something safer and funnier.

"Tom, can we play with the blocks and make a castle?" Anna asked.

Tom nodded. He liked blocks and castles. He agreed with Anna.

"Anna, yes, let's play with the blocks and make a castle. That sounds like fun," Tom said.

They went to the playroom and found the blocks. They started to build a big and beautiful castle. They forgot about the scissors and the cut. They had fun. They were happy.

Ben and Lily were adventurous twins who liked to explore new places. One day, they found a big suitcase in the attic. It was old and dusty, but it had a shiny buckle on it.

"Let's open it and see what's inside!" Ben said.

"Okay, but be careful. It might be locked or have something scary in it." Lily said.

They tried to pull the buckle, but it was too hard. They pushed and twisted it, but it did not move.

"I don't understand. How do we open it?" Ben asked.

"Maybe we need a key or a code or something." Lily said.

They looked around the attic for clues, but they did not find anything. They were about to give up, when they heard a voice.

"Hello, children. Do you want to play a game?" The voice came from the suitcase.

Ben and Lily were surprised and curious. They went closer to the suitcase and saw a small speaker on it.

"Who are you? Where are you?" Ben asked.

"I am the suitcase. I have been waiting for someone to open me for a long time. I have many secrets and treasures inside, but you have to solve a riddle to unlock me." The voice said.

"A riddle? What is a riddle?" Lily asked.

"A riddle is a question that has a clever or funny answer. If you guess the answer, you can open the buckle. If you don't, you can try again later. Do you want to try?" The voice said.

Ben and Lily nodded. They liked games and puzzles. They wanted to see what was inside the suitcase.

"Okay, here is the riddle. Listen carefully. What has a face and two hands, but no arms or legs?" The voice said.

Ben and Lily thought hard. They looked at each other and whispered.

"Is it a clock?" Ben said.

"Or a watch?" Lily said.

They decided to say both answers, just in case.

"A clock or a watch!" They shouted together.

The voice laughed.

"Very good, children. You are smart and adventurous. You guessed the riddle. You can open the buckle now. Go ahead and see what I have for you." The voice said.

Ben and Lily were excited. They pulled the buckle again, and this time it opened. They lifted the lid of the suitcase and saw a lot of colorful things inside. There were books and toys and clothes and pictures and more.

"Wow, look at all this stuff!" Ben said.

"It's amazing! It's like a treasure chest!" Lily said.

They started to take out the things and play with them. They found a storybook about pirates and a teddy bear with a patch and a dress with sparkles and a camera with a flash and more.

They thanked the voice and the suitcase for the game and the gifts. They had a lot of fun and learned new things. They decided to keep the suitcase as their secret friend and visit it often. They were happy and adventurous twins.

Lila and Lulu were twins. They liked to play with their dolls. They had many dolls, but their favorite was Molly. Molly had smooth hair and a pretty dress.

One day, Lila and Lulu had a fight. Lila wanted to play with Molly, but Lulu said no. She said Molly was her doll. Lila said no, Molly was their doll. They both pulled Molly's arms. Molly's dress ripped.

Lila and Lulu stopped pulling. They looked at Molly. They felt sad. They had hurt their doll. They had hurt each other.

"I'm sorry, Lulu," Lila said. "I didn't mean to rip Molly's dress."

"I'm sorry, Lila," Lulu said. "I didn't mean to be mean to you."

They hugged each other. They hugged Molly. They said they loved each other. They loved Molly.

They went to their mom. They showed her Molly's dress. They told her what happened. Mom smiled. She said she was proud of them for saying sorry. She said she could fix Molly's dress.

She took Molly and a needle and some thread. She sewed Molly's dress. She made it look new. She gave Molly back to Lila and Lulu. They thanked her. They said they would share Molly. They said they would not fight.

They went back to their room. They played with Molly. They made her shake her smooth hair. They made her talk. They made her laugh. They laughed too. They were happy. They were twins.

Tommy loved to draw with his pencil. He drew cars and planes and houses and animals. He drew on paper and on the wall and on the floor. Sometimes his mom got mad at him for making a mess, but Tommy did not care. He wanted to be an artist.

One day, Tommy found a big, blank canvas in the garage. It was white and smooth and perfect for his pencil. He dragged it to his room and put it on his bed. He climbed on the bed and started to draw. He drew a big sun and a blue sky and a green field. He drew a brown cow and a yellow duck and a pink pig. He was very happy.

"Tommy, what are you doing?" his mom asked, opening the door. She saw the canvas and the pencil and the drawings. She was very angry. "Tommy, this is not your canvas! This is your dad's canvas! He is a painter and he needs this canvas for his work! You ruined it with your filthy pencil!"

Tommy was scared. He did not know the canvas was his dad's. He did not know his dad was a painter. He thought his dad was a doctor. He wanted to say sorry, but he could not find the words.

His mom grabbed the canvas and the pencil and threw them in the trash. She told Tommy to go to the corner and think about what he did. Tommy went to the corner and cried. He felt very bad.

Later, his dad came home. He saw the trash and the canvas and the pencil and the drawings. He was very curious. He took them out and looked at them. He saw the sun and the sky and the field. He saw the cow and the duck and the pig. He smiled. He saw something else. He saw a small, faint signature at the bottom of the canvas. It said "Tommy".

He went to Tommy's room and found him in the corner. He knelt down and hugged him. He told him he was not mad. He told him he liked his drawings. He told him he was proud of him. He told him he was an artist.

Tommy was surprised. He looked at his dad and saw his smile. He smiled back. He felt very happy.

He asked his dad if he could draw with him. His dad said yes. He gave him a new pencil and a new canvas. He told him to stretch his imagination and have fun. Tommy did. He drew with his dad and they had fun. They were both artists.

Lily and Ben like to visit the park with Mom. They like to play on the swings, slide and sandbox. They also like to look for twigs and leaves on the ground. They make pretend houses and boats with them.

One day, they see a big pile of twigs near a tree. They run to it and start to take some. They do not see the sign that says "Do not touch". They do not hear Mom calling them to come back.

The pile of twigs is not just twigs. It is a nest for bees. The bees do not like Lily and Ben taking their twigs. They get angry and fly out of the nest. They buzz very loud and sting Lily and Ben all over.

Lily and Ben scream and cry. They drop the twigs and run to Mom. Mom hugs them and takes them to the car. She drives them to the doctor. The doctor gives them medicine and bandages. He says they will be okay, but they have to stay home for a few days.

Lily and Ben are very sad. They do not like bees. They do not like twigs. They do not want to visit the park again. They wish they had listened to Mom.

Sam and Lily were playing soccer in the park. They liked to kick the ball and run after it. Sometimes they would pass the ball to each other and try to score a goal.

"Pass me the ball, Lily!" Sam shouted. He was near the goal and wanted to try a shot.

Lily kicked the ball hard to Sam. But the ball was too fast and went over his head. It landed near a big tree, where a boy was sitting and reading a book.

"Hey, that's our ball!" Sam said. He ran to the tree and tried to get the ball back. But the boy did not let him. He held the ball in his arms and said, "No, this is my ball now. I found it."

"That's not fair!" Lily said. She ran to the tree too and tried to help Sam. "You did not find it, you took it. Give it back to us!"

The boy shook his head and said, "No, this is a brilliant ball. It is shiny and round and bouncy. I like it. It is mine."

Sam and Lily did not know what to do. They wanted their ball back, but the boy was bigger and stronger than them. They looked at each other and had an idea.

They both kneeled on the ground and pretended to cry. They made loud and sad noises. They said, "Please, please, give us our ball back. We love our ball. It is our favorite toy. We have nothing else to play with. Please, please, don't be mean."

The boy heard them and felt sorry for them. He did not like to see them cry. He said, "OK, OK, stop crying. Here, take your ball back. But you have to let me play with you. I have no friends to play with. Please, please, don't be mean."

Sam and Lily stopped crying and smiled. They said, "OK, OK, you can play with us. But you have to be nice and share the ball. We can all have fun together. Please, please, don't be mean."

The boy nodded and smiled too. He gave them the ball back and joined them. They all kicked the ball and ran after it. Sometimes they would pass the ball to each other and try to score a goal. They had a brilliant time.

Lily and Max were playing in their room. They had many toys, but they liked to look at the photo book best. The photo book had pictures of their family and friends. They liked to point at the faces and say their names.

"Look, this is Grandma and Grandpa," Lily said, showing Max a photo. "They are very nice and give us hugs and cookies."

Max nodded and smiled. He liked Grandma and Grandpa too. He turned the page and saw a photo of a big dog. He pointed at it and said, "Woof, woof!"

Lily giggled. She knew the dog's name was Spot. He was their uncle's dog. He was very friendly and liked to play fetch. She said, "Spot, Spot, good dog!"

They turned more pages and saw more photos. They saw their mom and dad, their cousins, their friends, and their teacher. They said hello to each one and made noises or gestures to match them.

They were having fun, but they did not know that their mom was sleeping in the next room. She had a headache and needed to rest. She heard their voices and felt frustrated. She wanted them to be quiet and let her sleep.

She got up and went to their room. She opened the door and saw them with the photo book. She said in a loud voice, "Lily and Max, what are you doing? You are making too much noise! You need to be quiet and let me sleep!"

Lily and Max were scared. They did not mean to make their mom angry. They loved their mom and did not want to hurt her. They said, "Sorry, mom, sorry!"

Their mom saw their faces and felt sorry too. She knew they were just playing and did not know she was sleeping. She said, "It's okay, my loves, I know you did not mean it. But you need to whisper when I am sleeping, okay? Whisper means to talk very softly, like this." She leaned down and whispered in their ears, "I love you very much."

Lily and Max nodded and whispered back, "I love you too, mom." They hugged their mom and gave her a kiss. Then they went back to the photo book and whispered to each other. They were happy and quiet. Their mom smiled and went back to her room. She closed the door and fell asleep.

Anna and Ben were playing in the park. They liked to run, jump and slide. They had a lot of fun. But after a while, they felt tired and thirsty.

"Let's rest for a bit," Anna said. "I have some juice and crackers in my bag."

"OK," Ben said. "I'm hungry too."

They sat down on a bench and opened Anna's bag. Anna gave Ben a juice box and a cracker. She took one for herself too.

They sipped their juice and nibbled their crackers. They felt better.

But then, Ben made a funny face. He spit out his cracker and said, "Yuck! This is spicy!"

Anna looked at her cracker. It had red dots on it. She remembered that her mom had packed some spicy crackers for her dad. She had taken the wrong bag by mistake.

"I'm sorry, Ben," Anna said. "These are not for us. These are for my dad. He likes spicy things."

Ben drank some more juice and said, "It's OK, Anna. I don't like spicy things. But I like you. You are my friend."

Anna smiled and said, "You are my friend too, Ben. Next time, I will bring some sweet things for us."

They hugged and finished their juice. Then they got up and played some more. They had a lot of fun.

Lily and Ben were best friends. They liked to play together in the park. One day, they found a big orange box under a tree. It had a sticker that said "mail".

"What is this?" Lily asked.

"Maybe it is a treasure!" Ben said. "Let's open it and see!"

They opened the box and saw many shiny things inside. There were necklaces, rings, bracelets, and earrings. They sparkled in the sun.

"Wow, this is a treasure!" Lily said. "We are so lucky!"

"Let's try them on!" Ben said. "We can pretend we are kings and queens!"

They put on the jewelry and laughed. They felt very happy and fancy. They did not see a man watching them from behind a bush. He had a mean face and a big bag. He was the one who had mailed the box. He wanted to trick someone into taking it, so he could steal it back. He was a bad man.

He waited until Lily and Ben were busy playing. Then he ran out of the bush and grabbed the box. He threw the jewelry into his bag and ran away.

"Hey, stop!" Lily and Ben shouted. "That is our treasure!"

But the man was too fast. He disappeared into the street.

Lily and Ben were very sad. They had lost their treasure. They cried and hugged each other.

"Don't worry," Lily said. "We still have each other. We are still best friends."

"Yes," Ben said. "And we still have our imagination. We can pretend we have any treasure we want."

They smiled and wiped their tears. They decided to play something else. They did not need the orange box. They had something more precious. They had friendship.

Lily was very happy. Today was her birthday. She had a party with her friends. They played games, ate cake and opened presents. Lily got a big doll from her mom and dad. She loved her doll very much.

But then, something bad happened. Lily saw Sam, her best friend, playing with her doll. She got angry. She ran to Sam and shouted, "That's mine! Give it back!" She grabbed the doll and pulled hard. Sam pulled back. They both fell down. The doll broke. Its head came off.

Lily and Sam started to cry. Their moms and dads came to see what was wrong. They saw the broken doll and the sad children. They felt sorry for them. They tried to fix the doll, but it was too late. The doll was gone.

Lily's mom hugged her and said, "I'm sorry, honey. I know you loved your doll. But you shouldn't have fought with Sam. He is your friend. He wanted to play with your doll, not hurt it. You need to say sorry to him."

Lily looked at Sam. He was still crying. He looked at her with his big eyes. He said, "I'm sorry, Lily. I didn't mean to break your doll. I liked your doll. I wanted to share it with you. Can we still be friends?"

Lily felt a warm feeling in her heart. She remembered that Sam was her best friend. He always made her laugh. He always shared his toys with her. He was nice to her. She said, "I'm sorry, too, Sam. I was mean to you. I should have let you play with my doll. You are my friend. I still like you."

Lily and Sam hugged each other. They stopped crying. They smiled. Their moms and dads smiled, too. They were happy that Lily and Sam made up. They said, "That's good, kids. You are good friends. Friends say sorry when they make mistakes. Friends forgive each other. Friends have fun together."

Lily and Sam nodded. They agreed. They went back to the party. They played with the other toys. They ate more cake. They had fun. They forgot about the broken doll. They remembered their friendship.

Lila and Ben were bored. They had no toys to play with. All their toys were in a big box. But the box had a lock. And they did not have the key.

"Where is the key?" Lila asked.

"I don't know," Ben said. "Maybe Mom has it."

They looked for Mom. But Mom was busy. She was making dough. She was going to bake a cake.

"Mom, can we have the key?" Lila asked.

"Not now, sweetie," Mom said. "I'm busy. Go play with something else."

But there was nothing else to play with. Lila and Ben were sad. They went back to the box. They tried to open it. But it was too hard.

"Maybe we can use something to unlock it," Ben said.

"Like what?" Lila asked.

Ben looked around. He saw a dull knife. It was on the table. Mom had used it to cut the dough.

"Maybe this will work," Ben said. He took the knife. He went to the box. He tried to put the knife in the lock. But it did not fit.

"Be careful, Ben," Lila said. "You might hurt yourself."

Ben did not listen. He pushed harder. He twisted the knife. He heard a click. He smiled.

"I did it!" he said. "I unlocked the box!"

He opened the box. He saw all their toys. He was happy. He took out his favorite car. He gave Lila her favorite doll.

"Look, Lila," he said. "We can play now!"

Lila was happy too. She hugged her doll. She thanked Ben.

"You're smart, Ben," she said. "You unlocked the box!"

They played with their toys. They had fun. They forgot about Mom and the dough. They did not hear Mom calling them.

"Kids, come here!" Mom said. "The cake is ready!"

But Lila and Ben did not hear. They were too busy playing. They were not bored anymore. They were happy.

Lila and Ben were playing in the yard. They liked to dig in the dirt and look for bugs. Sometimes they found worms, or ants, or beetles. They put them in a jar and watched them.

One day, they found something different. It was gray and hard and had many legs. It did not move or make any sound. Lila and Ben thought it was dead. They put it in the jar with the other bugs.

That night, Lila and Ben left the jar on the window sill. They went to bed and dreamed of bugs. But the gray thing was not dead. It was sleeping. And when the moon came out, it woke up. It was a firefly. It had a light in its belly that could glow.

The firefly saw the other bugs in the jar. They were scared and sad. They wanted to go out and be free. The firefly felt sorry for them. It used its light to make a hole in the lid of the jar. Then it flew out and helped the other bugs escape.

Lila and Ben woke up in the morning. They looked at the jar. It was empty. They saw a hole in the lid. They wondered what happened. They looked out the window. They saw the firefly and the other bugs flying away. They saw the firefly's light glow in the sun. They smiled and waved goodbye. They learned that some bugs are not dead, but magic.

Anna and Ben are twins. They like to play outside and look at the sky. They see many white clouds in the blue sky. They try to guess what the clouds look like.

"Look, Anna, that cloud looks like a bunny!" Ben says, pointing at a fluffy cloud.

"I see it, Ben, it has long ears and a tail. And that cloud looks like a flower!" Anna says, pointing at another cloud.

They giggle and clap their hands. They see more clouds that look like animals, fruits, and toys. They have fun making up stories about the clouds.

But then, the wind blows hard and the clouds start to move. Some of the clouds get smaller and some get bigger. Some of the clouds join together and some separate.

"Oh no, the bunny cloud is gone!" Ben says, looking sad.

"And the flower cloud too!" Anna says, frowning.

They watch as the clouds change shape and color. They do not look like anything they know anymore.

"Maybe the clouds are playing too," Anna says, trying to cheer up Ben.

"Maybe they are," Ben says, nodding.

They decide to keep watching the clouds and see what they do next. They hope the clouds will make new shapes that they can guess. They hold hands and smile. They still like the clouds, even if they are different.

Lily and Max were playing hide and seek in the big house. Lily was the seeker and Max was the hider. Lily counted to ten and then looked for Max. She checked the kitchen, the living room, and the bathroom, but she could not find him.

"Where are you, Max?" she called out. "I give up!"

She heard a giggle from behind a door. She ran to the door and opened it. It was the basement. She saw Max hiding behind a box. He had a playful smile on his face.

"Gotcha!" she said and ran towards him.

But then she saw something else in the basement. It was a big, black spider. It had eight legs and many eyes. It was crawling on the wall. Lily was very scared of spiders. She screamed and ran back to the door.

"Help! Help! Spider!" she cried.

Max heard her scream and saw the spider. He was not scared of spiders. He thought they were cool. He picked up a broom and tried to shoo the spider away.

"Don't worry, Lily, I'll save you!" he said.

But the spider was fast and angry. It jumped from the wall and landed on the broom. Max dropped the broom and backed away. He and Lily both trembled with fear. They wanted to get out of the basement.

"Where is the exit?" Lily asked.

Max looked around and saw a small window. It was high up, but he had an idea. He pushed the box he was hiding behind to the wall. He climbed on the box and reached for the window. He opened it and saw the garden outside.

"Come on, Lily, we can escape through here!" he said.

He helped Lily climb on the box and then through the window. They jumped down and ran to the house. They hugged each other and breathed a sigh of relief.

"That was scary!" Lily said.

"Yeah, but we made it!" Max said.

They decided to play something else. They did not want to go back to the basement. They hoped the spider would not follow them. They were glad they had each other. They were brave and playful friends.

Sam and Ben are brothers. They like to play with their toys. Sam has a big truck and Ben has a small car. They make noises and pretend to drive on the road.

One day, Sam sees Ben's car and wants to play with it. He says, "Give me your car, Ben. It is nice and shiny. My truck is old and dirty."

Ben says, "No, Sam. This is my car. You have your truck. Go away."

Sam does not listen. He tries to pull the car from Ben's hand. Ben holds on tight. They pull and pull and pull. The car breaks in half. They both cry.

Mom hears the noise and comes to see what is wrong. She sees the broken car and the sad boys. She says, "What happened here? Why did you break Ben's car, Sam?"

Sam says, "I wanted to play with it. It has a good style. My truck is dead."

Mom says, "That is not nice, Sam. You cannot take things that are not yours. You have to ask first. And you cannot break things that are not yours. You have to be careful. Now you have to say sorry to Ben and help him fix his car."

Sam feels bad. He says, "Sorry, Ben. I was wrong. Can we fix your car?"

Ben says, "Maybe. But we need glue and tape. And we need to be gentle."

Mom says, "I have glue and tape. Come with me. We will fix the car together. And then you can share and play nicely."

Sam and Ben follow Mom. They fix the car with glue and tape. It is not as shiny as before, but it still works. They say thank you to Mom. They hug each other. They play with the car and the truck. They are happy.

Tom and Lily are friends. They like to play outside. One day, they see a big kite in the sky. It is red and yellow and has a long tail.

"Wow, look at the kite!" Tom says. "It is so high and fast. I want to fly a kite too."

"Me too," Lily says. "Let's go and find one."

They run to the shed. They see a small kite. It is blue and green and has a star on it. They take the kite and a string. They go to the field.

They try to fly the kite. They run and run. But the kite does not go up. It falls to the ground.

"Why does it not fly?" Tom asks. "The wind is strong. It should fly."

"Maybe the string is too short," Lily says. "Or maybe the kite is too heavy."

They look at the kite. They see a problem. The kite has a hole in it. The wind goes through the hole. The kite does not hang in the air.

"Oh no, the kite is broken," Tom says. "How can we fix it?"

"Maybe we can use a patch," Lily says. "Or some tape. Or some glue."

They look for something to fix the kite. They see a big leaf. It is brown and dry. They think it can cover the hole.

They take the leaf. They put it on the hole. They use some grass to tie it. They hope it will work.

They try to fly the kite again. They run and run. The kite goes up. It hangs in the air. It moves with the wind. It looks like a bird.

"Yay, we did it!" Tom says. "The kite is flying. It is so pretty."

"Yay, we are so smart!" Lily says. "The leaf is a good patch. It is like a wing."

They laugh and clap. They watch the kite. They are happy.

But then, something bad happens. The wind gets stronger. It blows harder. It pulls the kite. The string breaks. The kite flies away.

"Uh oh, the kite is gone," Tom says. "The wind took it. We can't get it back."

"Uh oh, that is sad," Lily says. "The kite was ours. We liked it."

They are scared. They cry. They hug each other.

They see a man. He is walking in the field. He has a hat and a coat. He sees the kite. He catches it. He brings it to them.

"Hello, kids," he says. "Is this your kite? I saw it flying in the sky. It is a nice kite. But it has a hole in it. And a leaf on it. Did you do that?"

"Yes, sir," Tom says. "The kite was broken. We tried to fix it. But the wind was too strong. It broke the string. It flew away."

"Yes, sir," Lily says. "We were scared. We thought we lost it. We were sad. Thank you for finding it."

"You're welcome, kids," he says. "You are very clever. You used a leaf to patch the hole. That is a good idea. But you need a stronger string. And a smaller hole. Do you want me to help you?"

"Yes, please," Tom and Lily say. "We want to fly the kite again. We want to have fun."

"Okay, then," he says. "Let's go to my house. I have some tools and materials. We can fix the kite together. And then we can fly it again. How does that sound?"

"Good, good," Tom and Lily say. "Thank you, thank you."

They go with the man. They fix the kite. They fly it again. They are happy. The end.

Sara and Tom are brother and sister. They like to play in the garden. Sara is four and Tom is three. They have a big ball and a small car.

One day, they see a hole in the fence. They are curious. They want to know what is on the other side. They crawl through the hole. They see a big dog. The dog is brown and fluffy. It has a red collar.

"Hello, doggy!" Sara says. "Do you want to play with us?"

The dog wags its tail. It likes Sara and Tom. It runs to them and licks their faces. They giggle. They throw the ball and the dog fetches it. They push the car and the dog chases it. They have fun.

But then they hear their mom calling. "Sara! Tom! Where are you? It's time to come in and have a bath!"

They look at each other. They are dirty. They have mud on their clothes and their faces. The dog has mud on its fur and its collar.

"Uh-oh," Tom says. "We have to go, doggy. Bye-bye!"

They crawl back through the hole. They run to their mom. She sees them and gasps.

"What have you been doing?" she asks. "You are not clean at all! You need a bath right now!"

Sara and Tom nod. They are sorry. They hug their mom. They say goodbye to the dog. They hope they can play with it again. They go inside and have a bath. They wash the mud off. They become clean again. They are happy.

Tom and Jen are friends. They like to look at the stars at night. They have a big book with pictures of stars and planets. They want to see a comet. A comet is a star with a long tail. The book says a comet will come soon.

One night, Tom and Jen go outside with their book and a flashlight. They look at the sky. They see many stars, but no comet. They are sad. They want to see the comet.

"Where is the comet?" Tom asks.

"I don't know," Jen says. "Maybe it is late."

They wait and wait. They get cold and sleepy. They are not ready to go home. They want to see the comet.

Then, they see a bright light in the sky. It is the comet! It has a long tail. It is beautiful. Tom and Jen are happy. They jump and clap.

"Look, look, the comet!" Jen says.

"Wow, wow, the comet!" Tom says.

They look at the book. The book says the comet has a name. The name is Halley. Tom and Jen like the name.

"Hello, Halley!" Tom says.

"Hello, Halley!" Jen says.

They wave at the comet. The comet waves back. Tom and Jen smile. They are ready to go home. They have seen the comet. They are friends.

Sara was a gifted girl who liked to paint. She had many colors and brushes and papers. She painted flowers and trees and animals and people. She was happy when she painted.

One day, her teacher said, "Sara, you have a very good talent. I want to display your paintings in the school hall. Everyone can see them and admire them. Do you want to do that?"

Sara nodded and smiled. She was proud of her paintings. She wanted to share them with others. She said, "Yes, teacher, I want to do that. Thank you for liking my paintings."

The next day, Sara and her teacher went to the school hall. They hung Sara's paintings on the walls. They looked very beautiful and colorful. Sara saw her name on a sign. She felt happy.

Then, Sara saw her mom and dad at the gate. They came to see her paintings. They hugged her and said, "Sara, you are a gifted girl. We are very proud of you. Your paintings are wonderful. You have a very good talent."

Sara smiled and said, "Thank you, mom and dad. I love you. I love painting. I want to paint more and more."

Tommy loved ice cream. He liked to feel the cold and sweet in his mouth. He liked to lick the cone and make it last. He liked to choose different flavors every time.

One day, he went to the park with his mom. He saw a big ice cream truck. He ran to it and asked for a cone. The man gave him a cone with three scoops: chocolate, vanilla and strawberry. Tommy was very happy. He thanked the man and paid with his mom's money.

He walked back to his mom, holding his cone carefully. He saw a little girl on a bench. She had no ice cream. She looked sad. Tommy felt sorry for her. He wanted to share his ice cream with her. He walked to her and said, "Hi, I'm Tommy. Do you want some of my ice cream? It's delicious."

The little girl smiled. She said, "Hi, I'm Lily. Thank you, that's very nice of you. I would love some of your ice cream." She took a lick of the strawberry scoop. She said, "Mmm, this is my favorite flavor. You are very kind, Tommy."

Tommy and Lily became friends. They shared the cone and talked. They had fun. Tommy's mom saw them and smiled. She was proud of Tommy. She knew he had a big heart. She thought, "Sharing is caring. Tommy learned a good lesson today."

Anna and Ben are friends. They like to play with toys. One day, they find a big box in the park. The box has a picture of a yacht on it.

"Wow, look at this!" Anna says. "It is a yacht. A big boat that can go on the water."

"Can we open it?" Ben asks. "Maybe we can play with it."

Anna nods. She and Ben open the box. Inside, they see a yacht. But it is not a regular yacht. It is a toy yacht. It is made of plastic and has wheels.

"Wow, this is cool!" Ben says. "But how can we play with it? It cannot go on the water."

Anna thinks. She has an idea. She points to the slide in the park.

"Let's take it to the slide!" she says. "We can pretend that the slide is the water. We can make the yacht go down the slide and say 'whee!'"

Ben likes the idea. He and Anna take the yacht to the slide. They put it on the top and push it down. The yacht slides down fast and makes a noise.

"Whee!" Anna and Ben say. "This is fun!"

They play with the yacht on the slide for a long time. They are happy. They have a new toy and a new game.

Lily was a nosy girl. She liked to look at other people's things. One day, she saw a diary on her big sister's bed. She wanted to read it. She took the diary and opened it.

"Hey, that's mine!" her big sister, Anna, shouted. She ran into the room and grabbed the diary from Lily. "You can't read my diary, it's private!"

"But I want to know what you write," Lily said. "Why do you hide it?"

"Because it's none of your business," Anna said. "You are too little to understand. Now go away and play with your toys."

Lily was sad and angry. She did not like her big sister. She wanted to make her sorry. She saw a chew toy on the floor. It belonged to their dog, Spot. She had an idea. She took the chew toy and ran to the kitchen. She found some peanut butter and spread it on the chew toy. Then she went back to her sister's room and put the chew toy on the diary.

Soon, Spot smelled the peanut butter. He followed his nose to the diary. He saw the chew toy and licked it. He liked it. He started to chew it. He also chewed the diary. He tore the pages and made a mess.

Anna heard the noise and came back to her room. She saw Spot and the diary. She screamed. "No, Spot, stop! Bad dog! You ruined my diary!"

Lily heard the scream and smiled. She thought it was funny. She said, "Now you know how I feel. Maybe next time you will share with me."

Tom and Anna were playing hide and seek in the garden. Tom was the seeker and Anna was the hider. Anna ran behind a big bush and crouched down. She felt comfortable and safe. She hoped Tom would not find her.

Tom looked around the garden. He saw a ball, a swing, a slide, and a tree. He did not see Anna. He wondered where she was. He decided to check behind the bush. He walked slowly and quietly. He saw a cup on the ground. He picked it up and smiled. He had an idea.

He shouted, "Anna, Anna, where are you? I have a surprise for you!" He held the cup behind his back. He hoped Anna would come out.

Anna heard Tom's voice. She was curious. She wanted to see the surprise. She peeked out from behind the bush. She saw Tom standing with a cup. She asked, "What is it, Tom? What do you have?"

Tom said, "Come here, Anna. I will show you." He waited for Anna to come closer. He said, "Are you ready?" He moved the cup in front of him. He revealed a frog. He said, "Look, Anna. A frog!"

Anna screamed. She did not like frogs. She was scared. She ran away from Tom. She said, "No, Tom, no! I don't want a frog! That's not a surprise, that's a trick!"

Tom laughed. He said, "I found you, Anna. I win!" He put the frog back on the ground. He said, "Don't be mad, Anna. It was just a joke. Come on, let's play again."

Anna stopped running. She looked at Tom. She was still a little angry, but she also wanted to play. She said, "OK, Tom. But this time, I will be the seeker and you will be the hider. And no more frogs, OK?"

Tom nodded. He said, "OK, Anna. No more frogs. You can be the seeker and I will be the hider. But you have to count to ten first."

Anna agreed. She said, "OK, Tom. I will count to ten. One, two, three..." She closed her eyes and started counting. Tom ran away to find a good hiding spot. He hoped Anna would not find him. He also hoped he would not find another frog. He thought, "Hide and seek is fun."

Lily and Anna were best friends. They liked to play with dolls and dress up. One day, they found a pretty box under Lily's bed. It had a lock and a key.

"What is in the box?" Anna asked.

"I don't know. It is a secret," Lily said. She took the key and opened the box. Inside, there were many shiny things. There were rings, necklaces, bracelets, and earrings.

"Wow, they are so pretty!" Anna said. She reached for a ring.

"Stop! Don't touch them!" Lily said. She pulled the box away from Anna. "They are mine! They are from my grandma. She gave them to me before she went away. She said they are very special and I have to keep them safe."

"But I just want to look at them. Please, can I try one on?" Anna said. She felt sad and angry. She thought Lily was being mean and selfish.

"No, you can't! They are not for you. They are only for me. Go away!" Lily said. She closed the box and put it back under the bed. She turned her back to Anna.

Anna felt tears in her eyes. She did not want to play with Lily anymore. She got up and ran out of the room. She did not say goodbye.

Lily heard Anna leave. She felt lonely and sorry. She did not mean to hurt Anna. She loved her friend. She wanted to share her pretty things with her. But she was afraid to lose them. She remembered how her grandma hugged her and told her to take good care of them. She missed her grandma very much.

She got the box out again and opened it. She looked at the shiny things. They were pretty, but they did not make her happy. She wished Anna was there with her. She wanted to say sorry and give her a hug. She wanted to tell her the secret of the box. She wanted to play with her again.

She took the key and ran after Anna. She hoped she would find her and make up with her. She hoped Anna would still be her friend. She hoped they could seat together and look at the pretty things and smile.

Lila was a big girl who liked to drive her toy car. She had a pink car with four wheels and a horn. She liked to go fast and make noise. She also had a license that her dad made for her. It had her name and picture on it. She was very proud of her license.

One day, Lila wanted to drive her car to the park. She asked her mom if she could go. Her mom said yes, but she had to be careful and follow the rules. Lila said okay and put on her helmet. She took her license and her car and went outside.

On the way to the park, Lila saw a big, shiny car. It was a modern car with many buttons and lights. It looked very cool and fun. Lila wanted to see it closer. She drove her car next to the modern car and stopped. She looked at the driver. He was a man with a beard and glasses. He smiled at Lila and said hello.

"Hi," Lila said. "I like your car. It is very modern."

"Thank you," the man said. "I like your car too. It is very cute."

"Can I see your car?" Lila asked. "Can I touch the buttons?"

"Sure," the man said. "But you have to be careful. Some buttons are not for kids."

Lila nodded and got out of her car. She walked to the modern car and climbed inside. She saw many buttons and lights. She touched some of them. They made sounds and changed colors. She liked them a lot. She felt like a real driver.

The man watched Lila and laughed. He said she was a smart and curious girl. He asked her if she had a license. Lila said yes and showed him her license. He said it was very nice and asked her if she made it herself. Lila said no, her dad made it for her. He said her dad was very clever and kind.

Lila and the man talked for a while. They became friends. They shared stories and jokes. They had fun. Lila forgot about the park. She was happy in the modern car.

After some time, Lila felt tired. She yawned and rubbed her eyes. She said she wanted to sleep. The man said he was tired too. He said they should go back to their cars and sleep. Lila agreed. She said goodbye to the man and thanked him for letting her see his car. He said goodbye to Lila and thanked her for being his friend. He gave her a hug and a kiss.

Lila got out of the modern car and walked to her car. She got in and put on her helmet. She drove her car back to her house. She parked her car in the garage and took her license. She went inside and found her mom. She told her mom about her adventure and showed her her license. Her mom said she was very brave and adventurous. She said she was proud of her. She gave her a hug and a kiss.

Lila said she was hungry and sleepy. Her mom said she would make her some food and then tuck her in bed. Lila said okay and smiled. She ate her food and drank her milk. She brushed her teeth and put on her pajamas. She went to her room and climbed into her bed. She put her license under her pillow and hugged her teddy bear. She closed her eyes and fell asleep. She dreamed of driving the modern car with her new friend. She was happy.

Anna and Ben like to play in the kitchen. They pretend to cook and wash dishes. One day, they find a big green apple on the table. Anna wants to eat it, but Ben has an idea.

"Let's put the apple in the sink and see what happens," he says.

"Why?" Anna asks.

"Maybe it will float or sink or make bubbles," Ben says.

They fill the sink with water and drop the apple in. The apple sinks to the bottom. Anna and Ben are surprised.

"Look, the apple is under the water," Anna says.

"Maybe it is too heavy to float," Ben says.

They try to reach the apple with their hands, but the water is too deep. They look for a spoon or a fork, but they cannot find any.

"Mom, can you help us?" Anna calls.

Mom comes to the kitchen and sees the apple in the sink. She smiles and shakes her head.

"What are you doing, kids?" she asks.

"We wanted to see what the apple would do in the water," Ben says.

"Well, it looks like it remains in the sink," Mom says.

She drains the water and takes out the apple. She wipes it with a towel and cuts it into pieces.

"Here, you can share the apple now," she says.

Anna and Ben are happy. They thank Mom and eat the apple. They think it is very sweet and juicy. They decide to play with something else next time.

Tom and Lily were friends who liked to play in the garden. They liked to smell the herbs that grew there, like mint and rosemary. They liked to see the sun shine on the flowers and the bees. They liked to hear the birds sing and the wind blow.
